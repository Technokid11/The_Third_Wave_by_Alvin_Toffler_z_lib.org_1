                              Wave. Her tough, tenacious criticism of my ideas and her
                              professionalism as an editor are reflected on every page.

                              Her contributions to this book extend far beyond those one would
                              expect of a colleague, an intellectual companion, a friend, lover and
                              wife.

                              INTRODUCTION

                              In a time when terrorists play death-games with hostages, as
                              currencies careen amid rumors of a third World War, as embassies
                              flame and storm troopers lace up their boots in many lands, we stare in
                              horror at the headlines. The price of gold—that sensitive barometer of
                              fear—breaks all records. Banks tremble. Inflation rages out of control.
                              And the governments of the world are reduced to paralysis or
                              imbecility.

                              Faced with all this, a massed chorus of Cassandras fills the air with
                              doom-song. The proverbial man hi the street says the world has "gone
                              mad," while the expert points to all the trends leading toward
                              catastrophe.

                              This book offers a sharply different view.

                              It contends that the world has not swerved into lunacy, and that, in fact,
                              beneath the clatter and jangle of seemingly senseless events there lies
                              a startling and potentially hopeful pattern. This book is about that
                              pattern and that hope.

                              The Third Wave is for those who think the human story, far from
                              ending, has only just begun.]]></page><page Index="7"><![CDATA[A powerful tide is surging across much of the world today, creating a
                              new, often bizarre, environment in which to work, play, marry, raise
                              children, or retire. In this bewildering context, businessmen swim
                              against highly erratic economic currents; politicians see their ratings
                              bob wildly up and down; universities, hospitals, and other institutions
                              battle desperately against inflation. Value systems splinter and crash,
                              while the lifeboats of family, church, and state are hurled madly about.

                              Looking at these violent changes, we can regard them as

                              4

                              2 THE THIRD WAVE

                              isolated evidences of instability, breakdown, and disaster. Yet, if we
                              stand back for a longer view, several things become apparent that
                              otherwise go unnoticed.

                              To begin with, many of today's changes are not independent of one
                              another. Nor are they random. For example, the crack-up of the
                              nuclear family, the global energy crisis, the spread of cults and cable
                              television, the rise of flextime and new fringe-benefit packages, the
                              emergence of separatist movements from Quebec to Corsica, may all
                              seem like isolated events. Yet precisely the reverse is true. These and
                              many other seemingly unrelated events or trends are niter-connected.
                              They are, in fact, parts of a much larger phenomenon: the death of
                              industrialism and the rise of a new civilization.

                              So long as we think of them as isolated changes and miss this larger
                              significance, we cannot design a coherent, effective response to them.
                              As individuals, our personal decisions remain aimless or self-
                              canceling. As governments, we stumble from crisis to crash program,
                              lurching into the future without plan, without hope, without vision.

                              Lacking a systematic framework for understanding the clash of forces
                              in today's world, we are like a ship's crew, trapped in a storm and
                              trying to navigate between dangerous reefs without compass or chart.
                              In a culture of warring specialisms, drowned in fragmented data and
                              fine-toothed analysis, synthesis is not merely useful—it is crucial.

                              For this reason, The Third Wave is a book of large-scale synthesis. It
                              describes the old civilization in which many of us grew up, and
                              presents a careful, comprehensive picture of the new civilization
                              bursting into being in our midst.

                              So profoundly revolutionary is this new civilization that it challenges all
                              our old assumptions. Old ways of thinking, old formulas, dogmas, and
                              ideologies, no matter how cherished or how useful hi the past, no
                              longer fit the facts. The world that is fast emerging from the clash of
                              new values and technologies, new geopolitical relationships, new life-
                              styles and modes of communication, demands wholly new ideas and
                              analogies, classifications and concepts. We cannot cram the
                              embryonic world of tomorrow into yesterday's conventional
                              cubbyholes. Nor are the orthodox attitudes or moods appropriate.]]></page><page Index="8"><![CDATA[Thus, as the description of this strange new civilization unfolds in these

                              prevalent today. Despair—salable and self-indulgent—has dominated
                              the culture for a decade or

                              INTRODUCTION 3

                              more. The Third Wave concludes that despair is not only a sin (as C.
                              P. Snow, I believe, once put it), but that it is also unwarranted.

                              I am under no Pollyannaish illusions, It is scarcely necessary today to
                              elaborate on the real dangers facing us—from nuclear annihilation and
                              ecological disaster to racial fanaticism or regional violence. I have
                              written about these dangers myself in the past, and will no doubt do so
                              again. War, economic debacle, large-scale technological disaster—any
                              of these could alter future history in catastrophic ways.

                              Nevertheless, as we explore the many new relationships springing
                              up—between changing energy patterns and new forms of family life, or
                              between advanced manufacturing methods and the self-help
                              movement, to mention only a few—we suddenly discover that many of
                              the very same conditions that produce today's greatest perils also open
                              fascinating new potentials.

                              The Third Wave shows us these new potentials. It argues that, in the
                              very midst of destruction and decay, we can now find striking
                              evidences of birth and life. It shows clearly and, I think, indisputably,
                              that—with intelligence and a modicum of luck—the emergent
                              civilization can be made more sane, sensible, and sustainable, more
                              decent and more democratic than any we have ever known.

                              If the main argument of this book is correct, there are powerful reasons
                              for long-range optimism, even if the transitional years immediately
                              ahead are likely to be stormy and crisis-ridden.

                              As I've worked on The Third Wave in the past few years, lecture
                              audiences have repeatedly asked me how it differs from my earlier
                              work Future Shock.

                              Author and reader never see quite the same things in a book. I view
                              The Third Wave as radically different from Future Shock in both form
                              and focus. To begin with, it covers a much wider sweep of time—past
                              as well as future. It is more prescriptive. Its architecture is different.
                              (The perceptive reader will find that its structure mirrors its central
                              metaphor—the clash of waves.)

                              Substantively, the differences are even more pronounced. While
                              Future Shock called for certain changes to be made, it emphasized the
                              personal and social costs of change. The Third Wave, while taking
                              note of the difficulties of adapta-

                              tion, emphasizes the equally important costs of not changing certain
                              things rapidly enough.]]></page><page Index="9"><![CDATA[Moreover, while in the earlier book I wrote of the "premature arrival of
                              the future," I did not attempt to sketch the emergent society of
                              tomorrow in any comprehensive or systematic way. The focus of the
                              book was on the processes of change, not the directions of change.

                              In this book, the lens is reversed. I concentrate less on acceleration, as
                              such, and more on the destinations toward which change is carrying
                              us. Thus one work focuses more heavily on process, the other on
                              structure. For these reasons, the two books are designed to fit
                              together, not as source and sequel, but as complementary parts of a
                              much larger whole. Each is very different. But each casts light on the
                              other.

                              In attempting so large-scale a synthesis, it has been necessary to
                              simplify, generalize, and compress. (Without doing so, it would have
                              been impossible to cover so much ground in a single volume.) As a
                              result, some historians may take issue with the way this book divides
                              civilization into only three parts—a First Wave agricultural phase, a
                              Second Wave industrial phase, and a Third Wave phase now
                              beginning.

                              It is easy to point out that agricultural civilization consisted of quite
                              different cultures, and that industrialism itself has actually gone through
                              many successive stages of development One could, no doubt, chop
                              the past (and the future) into 12 or 38 or 157 pieces. But, in so doing,
                              we would lose sight of the major divisions hi a clutter of subdivisions.
                              Or we would require a whole library, instead of a single book, to cover
                              the same territory. For our purposes, the simpler distinctions are more
                              useful, even if gross.

                              The vast scope of this book also required the use of other shortcuts.
                              Thus I occasionally reify civilization itself, arguing that First Wave or
                              Second Wave civilization "did" this or that. Of course, I know, and
                              readers know, that civilizations don't do anything; people do. But
                              attributing this or that to a civilization now and then saves time and
                              breath.

                              Similarly, intelligent readers understand that no one—historian or
                              futurist, planner, astrologer, or evangelist—"knows" or can "know" the
                              future. When I say something "will" happen, I assume the reader will
                              make appropriate discount for uncertainty. To have done otherwise
                              would have burdened the book with an unreadable and unnecessary
                              jungle of reservations. Social forecasts, moreover, are never value-free
                              or

                              INTRODUCTION 5

                              scientific, no matter how much computerized data they use. The Third
                              Wave is not an objective forecast, and it makes no pretense to being
                              scientifically proven.

                              To say this, however, is not to suggest that the ideas in this book are
                              whimsical or unsystematic. In fact, as will soon become apparent, this
                              work is based on massive evidence and on what might be called a
                              semi-systematic model of civilization and our relationships to it.]]></page><page Index="10"><![CDATA[It describes the dying industrial civilization in terms of a "techno-
                              sphere," a "socio-sphere," an "info-sphere," and a "power-sphere,"
                              then sets out to show how each of these is undergoing revolutionary
                              change in today's world. It attempts to show the relationships of these
                              parts to each other, as well as the "bio-sphere" and "psycho-sphere"—
                              that structure of psychological and personal relationships through
                              which changes in the outer world affect our most private lives.

                              The Third Wave holds that a civilization also makes use of certain
                              processes and principles, and that it develops its own "super-ideology"
                              to explain reality and to justify its own existence.

                              Once we understand how these parts, processes, and principles are
                              interrelated, and how they transform one another, touching off powerful
                              currents of change, we gain a much clearer understanding of the giant
                              wave of change battering our lives today.

                              The grand metaphor of this work, as should already be apparent, is
                              that of colliding waves of change. This image is not original. Norbert
                              Elias, in his The Civilizing Process, refers to "a wave of advancing
                              integration over several centuries." In 1837, a writer described the
                              settlement of the American West in terms of successive "waves"—first
                              the pioneers, then the farmers, then the business interests, the "third
                              wave" of migration. In 1893, Frederick Jackson Turner cited and
                              employed the same analogy in his classic essay The Significance of
                              the Frontier in American History. It is not, therefore, the wave metaphor
                              that is fresh, but its application to today's civ-ilizational shift.

                              This application proves to be extremely fruitful. The wave idea is not
                              only a tool for organizing vast masses of highly diverse information. It
                              also helps us see beneath the raging surface of change. When we
                              apply the wave metaphor, much that was confusing becomes clear.
                              The familiar often appears in a dazzlingly fresh light.

                              s

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              Once I began thinking in terms of waves of change, colliding and
                              overlapping, causing conflict and tension around us, it changed my
                              perception of change itself. In every field, from education and health to
                              technology, from personal life to politics, it became possible to
                              distinguish those innovations that are merely cosmetic, or just
                              extensions of the industrial past, from those that are truly revolutionary.

                              Even the most powerful metaphor, however, is capable of yielding only
                              partial truth. No metaphor tells the whole story from all sides, and
                              hence no vision of the present, let alone the future, can be complete or
                              final. When I was a Marxist during my late teens and early twenties—
                              now more than a quarter of a century ago—I, like many young people,
                              thought I had all the answers. I soon learned that my "answers" were
                              partial, one-sided, and obsolete. More to the point, I came to
                              appreciate that the right question is usually more important than the
                              right answer to the wrong question.]]></page><page Index="11"><![CDATA[My hope i« thai The Third Wave, at the same time that it provides
                              answers, asks many fresh questions.

                              The recognition that no knowledge can be complete, no metaphor
                              entire, is itself humanizing. It counteracts fanati-cism. It grants even to
                              adversaries the possibility of partial I mill, and to oneself the possibility
                              of error. This possibility is especially present in large-scale synthesis.
                              Yet, as the critic George Steiner has written, "To ask larger questions
                              is to risk getting things wrong. Not to ask them at all is to constrain the
                              life of understanding."

                              In a time of exploding change—with personal lives being torn apart, the
                              existing social order crumbling, and a fantastic new way of life
                              emerging on the horizon—asking the very largest of questions about
                              our future is not merely a matter of intellectual curiosity. It is a matter of
                              survival.

                              Whether we know it or not, most of us are already engaged in either
                              resisting—or creating—the new civilization. The Third Wave will, I
                              hope, help each of us to choose.

                              SUPER-STRUGGLE

                              A new civilization is emerging in our lives, and blind men everywhere
                              are trying to suppress it. This new civilization brings with it new family
                              styles; changed ways of working, loving, and living; a new economy;
                              new political conflicts; and beyond all this an altered consciousness as
                              well. Pieces of this new civilization exist today. Millions are already
                              attuning their lives to the rhythms of tomorrow. Others, terrified of the
                              future, are engaged in a desperate, futile flight into the past and are
                              trying to restore the dying world that gave them birth.

                              The dawn of this new civilization is the single most explosive fact of our
                              lifetimes.

                              It is the central event—the key to understanding the years immediately
                              ahead. It is an event as profound as that First Wave of change
                              unleashed ten thousand years ago by the invention of agriculture, or
                              the earthshaking Second Wave of change touched off by the industrial

                              We grope for words to describe the full power and reach of this
                              extraordinary change. Some speak of a looming Space Age,
                              Information Age, Electronic Era, or Global Village. Zbigniew Brzezinski
                              has told us we face a "technetronic age." Sociologist Daniel Bell
                              describes the coming of a "post-industrial society." Soviet futurists
                              speak of the S.T.R.—the "scientific-technological revolution." I myself
                              have written extensively about the arrival of a "super-industrial
                              society." Yet none of these terms, including my own, is adequate.

                              Some of these phrases, by focusing on a single factor, nar-

                              that a new society can come into our lives smoothly, without conflict or
                              stress. None of these terms even begins to convey the full force,
                              scope, and dynamism of the changes rushing toward us or of the
                              pressures and conflicts they trigger.

                              Humanity faces a quantum leap forward. It faces the deepest social
                              upheaval and creative restructuring of all time. Without clearly
                              recognizing it, we are engaged in building a remarkable new civilization
                              from the ground up. This is the meaning of the Third Wave.

                              Until now the human race has undergone two great waves of change,
                              each one largely obliterating earlier cultures or civilizations and
                              replacing them with ways of life inconceivable to those who came
                              before. The First Wave of change— the agricultural revolution—took
                              thousands of years to play itself out. The Second Wave—the rise of
                              industrial civilization—took a mere three hundred years. Today history
                              is even more accelerative, and it is likely that the Third Wave will
                              sweep across history and complete itself in a few decades. We, who
                              happen to share the planet at this explosive moment, will therefore feel
                              the full impact of the Third Wave in our own lifetimes.

                              Tearing our families apart, rocking our economy, paralyzing our
                              political systems, shattering our values, the Third Wave affects
                              everyone. It challenges all the old power relationships, the privileges
                              and prerogatives of the endangered elites of today, and provides the
                              backdrop against, which the key power struggles of tomorrow will be
                              fought

                              Much in this emerging civilization contradicts the old traditional
                              industrial civilization. It is, at one and the same time, highly
                              technological and anti-industrial.

                              The Third Wave brings with it a genuinely new way of life based on
                              diversified, renewable energy sources; on methods of production that
                              make most factory assembly lines obsolete; on new, non-nuclear
                              families; on a novel institution that might be called the "electronic
                              cottage"; and on radically changed schools and corporations of the
                              future. The emergent civilization writes a new code of behavior for us
                              and carries us beyond standardization, synchronization, and
                              centralization, beyond the concentration of energy, money, and power.

                              This new civilization, as it challenges the old, will topple bureaucracies,
                              reduce the role of the nation-state, and give

                              democratic than any we know today. It is a civilization with its own

                              THE REVOLUTIONARY PREMISE

                              Two apparently contrasting images of the future grip the popular
                              imagination today. Most people—to the extent that they bother to think
                              about the future at all—assume the world they know will last
                              indefinitely. They find it difficult to Imngine a truly different way of life
                              for themselves, let alone a totally new civilization. Of course they
                              recognize that things arc changing. But they assume today's changes
                              will somehow pass them by and that nothing will shake the familiar
                              economic framework and political structure. They confidently expect
                              the future to continue the present

                              This straight-line thinking comes in various packages. At one level it
                              appears as an unexamined assumption lying be-hind the decisions of
                              businessmen, teachers, parents, and politicians. At a more
                              sophisticated level it comes dressed up hi statistics, computerized
                              data, and forecasters* jargon. Either way it adds up to a vision of a
                              future world that is essentially "more of the same"—Second Wave
                              industrialism writ even larger and spread over more of this planet

                              Recent events have severely shaken this confident image of the future.
                              As crisis after crisis has crackled across the headlines, as Iran erupted,
                              as Mao was de-deified, as oil prices skyrocketed and inflation ran wild,
                              as terrorism spread and governments seemed helpless to stop it, a
                              bleaker vision has become increasingly popular. Thus, large numbers
                              of people —fed on a steady diet of bad news, disaster movies,
                              apocalyptic Bible stories, and nightmare scenarios issued by
                              prestigious think tanks—have apparently concluded that today's
                              society cannot be projected into the future because there is no future.

                              For them, Armageddon is only minutes away. The earth is racing
                              toward its final cataclysmic shudder.

                              On the surface these two visions of the future seem very different. Yet
                              both produce similar psychological and political effects. For both lead
                              to the paralysis of imagination and will.

                              If tomorrow's society is simply an enlarged, Cinerama version of the
                              present, there is little we need do to prepare for it. If, on the other
                              hand, society is inevitably destined to self-destruct within our lifetime,
                              there is nothing we caw do about it. In short, both these ways of
                              looking at the future generate privatism and passivity. Both freeze us
                              into inaction.

                              Yet, in trying to understand what is happening to us, we are not limited
                              to this simpleminded choice between Armageddon and More-of-the-
                              Same. There are many more clarifying and constructive ways to think
                              about tomorrow— ways that prepare us for the future and, more
                              important, help us to change the present.

                              This book is based on what I call the "revolutionary premise." It
                              assumes that, even though the decades immediately ahead are likely]]></page><page Index="14"><![CDATA[to be filled with upheavals, turbulence, perhaps even widespread
                              violence, we will not totally destroy ourselves. It assumes that the
                              jolting changes we are now experiencing are not chaotic or random but
                              that, in fact, they form a sharp, clearly discernible pattern. It assumes,
                              moreover, that these changes are cumulative—that they add up to a
                              giant transformation in the way we live, work, play, and think, and that
                              a sane and desirable future is possible. In short, what follows begins
                              with the premise that what is happening now is nothing less than a
                              global revolution, a quantum jump in history.

                              Put differently, this book flows from the assumption that we are the
                              final generation of an old civilization and ,the first generation of a new
                              one, and that much of our personal confusion, anguish, and
                              disorientation can be traced directly to the conflict within us, and within
                              our political institutions, between the dying Second Wave civilization
                              and the emergent Third Wave civilization that is thundering in to take
                              its place.

                              When we finally understand this, many seemingly senselesi events
                              become suddenly comprehensible. The broad patterns of change
                              begin to emerge clearly. Action for survival be-1 comes possible and
                              plausible again. In short, the revolutionary premise liberates our
                              intellect and our will.

                              THE LEADING EDGE

                              To say the changes we face will be revolutionary, however, is not
                              enough. Before we can control or channel them wo need a fresh way
                              to identify and analyze them. Without this we are hopelessly lost.

                              One powerful new approach might be called social "wave-front"
                              analysis. It looks at history as a succession of rolling waves of change
                              and asks where the leading edge of each wave is carrying us. It
                              focuses our attention not so much on the continuities of history
                              (important as they are) as on the discontinuities—the innovations and
                              breakpoints. It identifies key change patterns as they emerge, so that
                              we can influence them.

                              Beginning with the very simple idea that the rise of agriculture was the
                              first turning point hi human social development, and that the industrial
                              revolution was the second great breakthrough, it views each of these
                              not as a discrete, one-time event but as a wave of change moving at a
                              certain velocity.

                              Before the First Wave of change, most humans lived in small, often
                              migratory groups and fed themselves by foraging, fishing, hunting, or
                              herding. At some point, roughly ten millennia ago, the agricultural
                              revolution began, and it crept slowly across the planet spreading
                              villages, settlements, cultivated land, and a new way of life.

                              This First Wave of change had not yet exhausted itself by the end of
                              the seventeenth century, when the industrial revolution broke over
                              Europe and unleashed the second great wave of planetary change.
                              This new process—industrialization—began moving much more rapidly]]></page><page Index="15"><![CDATA[across nations and continents. Thus two separate and distinct change
                              processes were rolling across the earth simultaneously, at different
                              speeds.

                              Today the First Wave has virtually subsided. Only a few tiny tribal
                              populations, in South America or Papua Now Guinea, for example,
                              remain to be reached by agriculture. But the force of this great First
                              Wave has basically been spent.

                              Meanwhile, the Second Wave, having revolutionized life in Europe,
                              North America, and some other parts of the globe in a few short
                              centuries, continues to spread, as many countries, until now basically
                              agricultural, scramble to build steel mills, auto plants, textile factories,
                              railroads, and food processing

                              plants. The momentum of industrialization is still felt. The Second
                              Wave has not entirely spent in force.

                              But even as this process continues, another, even more important, has
                              begun. For as the tide of industrialism peaked in the decades after
                              World War II, a little-understood Third Wave began to surge across the
                              earth, transforming everything it touched.

                              Many countries, therefore, are feeling the simultaneous impact of two,
                              even three, quite different waves of change, all moving at different
                              rates of speed and with different degrees of force behind them.

                              For the purposes of this book we shall consider the First Wave era to
                              have begun sometime around 8000 B.C. and to have dominated the
                              earth unchallenged until sometime around A.D. 1650-1750. From this
                              moment on, the First Wave lost momentum as the Second Wave
                              picked up steam. Industrial civilization, the product of this Second
                              Wave, then dominated the planet in its turn until it, too, crested. This
                              latest historical turning point arrived in the United States during the
                              decade beginning about 1955—the decade that saw white-collar and
                              service workers outnumber blue-collar workers for the first time. This
                              was the same decade that saw the widespread introduction of the
                              computer, commercial jet travel, the birth control pill, and many other
                              high-impact innovations. It was precisely during this decade that the
                              Third Wave began to gather its force in the United States. Since then it
                              has arrived—at slightly different dates—in most of the other industrial
                              nations, including Britain, France, Sweden, Germany, the Soviet
                              Union, and Japan. Today all the high-technology nations are reeling
                              from the collision between the Third Wave and the obsolete, encrusted
                              economies and institutions of the Second.

                              Understanding this is the secret to making sense of much of the
                              political and social conflict we see around us.

                              the pattern of future development is relatively easy to discern. Writers,
                              artists, journalists, and others discover the "wave of the future." Thus in
                              nineteenth-century Europe many thinkers, business leaders,
                              politicians, and ordinary people held a clear, basically correct image of
                              the fu-

                              ture. They sensed that history was moving toward the ultimate triumph
                              of industrialism over premechanized agriculture, and they foresaw with
                              considerable accuracy many of the changes that the Second Wave
                              would bring with it: more powerful technologies, bigger cities, faster
                              transport, mass education, and the like.

                              This clarity of vision had direct political effects. Parties and political
                              movements were able to triangulate with respect to the future.
                              Preindustrial agricultural interests organized a rearguard action against
                              encroaching industrialism, against "big business," against "union
                              bosses," against "sinful cities." Labor and management grappled for
                              control of the main levers of the emergent industrial society. Ethnic and
                              racial minorities defining their rights in terms of an improved role in the
                              industrial world, demanded access to jobs, corporate positions, urban
                              housing, better wages, mass public education, and so forth.

                              This industrial vision of the future had important psychological effects
                              as well. People might disagree; they might engage in sharp,
                              occasionally even bloody, conflict. Depressions and boom times might
                              disrupt their lives. Nevertheless, in general, (he shared image of an
                              industrial future tended to define options, to give individuals a sense
                              not merely of who or what they were, but of what they were likely to
                              become. It provided a degree of stability and a sense of self, even in
                              the midst of extreme social change.

                              In contrast, when a society is struck by two or more giant\ waves of
                              change, and none is yet clearly dominant, the image V of the future is
                              fractured. It becomes extremely difficult to \ sort out the meaning of the
                              changes and conflicts that arise^JL The collision of wave fronts creates
                              a raging ocean, full or clashing currents, eddies, and maelstroms which
                              conceal the deeper, more important historic tides.

                              In the United States today—as in many other countries—the"| collision
                              of Second and Third Waves creates social tensions, I dangerous
                              conflicts, and strange new political wave fronts that I cut across the
                              usual divisions of class, race, sex, or party. This \ collision makes a
                              shambles of traditional political vocabularies I and makes it very
                              difficult to separate the progressives from the \ reactionaries, friends
                              from enemies. All the old polarizations *"" and coalitions break up.
                              Unions and employers, despite their differences, join to fight
                              environmentalists. Blacks and Jews, once united in the battle against
                              discrimination, become adversaries.

                              THE THIRD WAVE]]></page><page Index="17"><![CDATA[In many nations, labor, which has traditionally favored "progressive"
                              policies such as income redistribution, now often holds "reactionary"
                              positions with respect to women's rights, family codes, immigration,
                              tariffs, or regionalism. The traditional "left" is often pro-centalization,
                              highly nationalistic, and antienvironmentalist.

                              At the same time we see politicians, from Valery Giscard d'Estaing to
                              Jimmy Carter or Jerry Brown, espousing "conservative" attitudes
                              toward economics and "liberal" attitudes toward art, sexual morality,
                              women's rights, or ecological controls. No wonder people are confused
                              and give up trying to make sense of their world.

                              The media, meanwhile, report a seemingly endless succession of
                              innovations, reversals, bizarre events, assassinations, kidnappings,
                              space shots, governmental breakdown, commando raids, and
                              scandals, all seemingly unrelated.

                              The apparent incoherence of political life is mirrored in personality
                              disintegration. Psychotherapists and gurus do a land-office business;
                              people wander aimlessly amid competing therapies, from primal
                              scream to est. They slip into cults and covens or, alternatively, into a
                              pathological privatism, convinced that reality is absurd, insane, or
                              meaningless. Life may indeed be absurd in some large, cosmic sense.
                              But this hardly proves that there is no pattern in today's events. In fact,
                              there is a distinct, hidden order that becomes detectable as soon as
                              we learn to distinguish Third Wave changes from those associated with
                              the diminishing Second Wave.

                              An understanding of the conflicts produced by these colliding wave
                              fronts gives us not only a clearer image of alternative futures but an X
                              ray of the political and social forces acting on us. It also offers insight
                              into our own private roles in history. For each of us, no matter how
                              seemingly unimportant, is a living piece of history.

                              The crosscurrents created by these waves of change are reflected in
                              our work, our family life, our sexual attitudes and personal morality.
                              They show up in our life-styles and voting behavior. For in our personal
                              lives and in our political acts, whether we know it or not, most of us in
                              the rich countries are essentially either Second Wave people
                              committed to maintaining the dying order, Third Wave people
                              constructing a radically different tomorrow, or a confused, self-
                              canceling mixture of the two.

                              amounts to little more than a dispute over who will squeeze the most
                              advantage from what remains of the declining industrial system. Put
                              differently, they are engaged in a squabble for the proverbial deck
                              chairs on a sulking Titanic.]]></page><page Index="18"><![CDATA[The more basic political question, as we shall see, is not who controls
                              the last days of industrial society but who shapes the new civilization
                              rapidly rising to replace it. While short-range political skirmishes
                              exhaust our energy and attention, a far more profound battle is already
                              taking place beneath the surface. On one side are the partisans of the
                              industrial past; on the other, growing millions who recognize that the
                              most urgent problems of the world—food, energy, arms control,
                              population, poverty, resources, ecology, climate, the problems of the
                              aged, the breakdown of urban community, the need for productive,
                              rewarding work—can no longer be resolved within the framework of
                              the industrial order.

                              This conflict is the "super-struggle" for tomorrow.

                              This confrontation between the vested interests of the Second Wave
                              and the people of the Third Wave already runs like an electric current
                              through the political life of every nation. Even in the non-industrial
                              countries of the world, all the old battle lines have been forcibly
                              redrawn by the arrival of the Third Wave. The old war of agricultural,
                              often feudal, interests against industrializing elites, either capitalist or
                              socialist, takes on a new dimension hi light of the coming
                              obsolescence of industrialism. Now that Third Wave civilization is
                              making its appearance, does rapid industrialization imply liberation
                              from neocolonialism and poverty—or does it, in fact, guarantee
                              permanent dependency?

                              It is only against this wide-screen background that we can begin to
                              make sense of the headlines, to sort out our priorities, to frame
                              sensible strategies for the control of change in our lives.

                              Once we realize that a bitter struggle is now raging between those who
                              seek to preserve industrialism and those who seek to supplant it, we
                              have a powerful new key to understanding the world. More important—

                              for changing that world.]]></page><page Index="19"><![CDATA[To use this tool, however, we must be able to distinguish clearly those
                              changes that extend the old industrial civilization from those which
                              facilitate the arrival of the new. We must, in short, understand both the
                              old and the new, the Second Wave industrial system into which so
                              many of us were born and the Third Wave civilization that we and our
                              children will inhabit.

                              In the chapters that follow, we return for a closer look at the first two
                              waves of change as a preparation for our exploration of the third. We
                              shall see that Second Wave civilization was not an accidental jumble of
                              components, but a system with parts that interacted with each other in
                              more or less predictable ways—and that the fundamental patterns of
                              industrial life were the same hi country after country, regardless of
                              cultural heritage or political difference. This is the civilization that
                              today's "reactionaries"—both "left-" and "right-wing"—are fighting to
                              preserve. It is this world that is threatened by history's Third Wave of
                              civilizational change.


                              THE ARCHITECTURE

                              OF CIVILIZATION

                              Three hundred years ago, give or take a half-century, an explosion
                              was heard that sent concussive shock waves racing across the earth,
                              demolishing ancient societies and creating a wholly new civilization.
                              This explosion was, of course, the industrial revolution. And the giant
                              tidal force is set loose on the world—the Second Wave—collided with
                              all the institutions of the past and changed the way of life of millions.

                              During the long millennia when First Wave civilization reigned
                              supreme, the planet's population could have been divided into two
                              categories—the "primitive" and the "civilized." The so-called primitive
                              peoples, living in small bands and tribes and subsisting by gathering,
                              hunting, or fishing, were those who had been passed over by the
                              agricultural revolution.

                              The "civilized" world, by contrast, was precisely that part of the planet
                              on which most people worked the soil. For wherever agriculture arose,
                              civilization took root. ^From China and India to Benin and Mexico, in
                              Greece and Rome, civilizations rose and fell, fought and fused in
                              endless, colorful admixture.

                              However, beneath their differences lay fundamental similarities. In all
                              of them, land was the basis of economy, life, culture, family structure,
                              and politics. In all of them, life was organized around the village. In all
                              of them, a simple division of labor prevailed and a few clearly defined
                              castes and classes arose: a nobility, a priesthood, warriors, helots,
                              slaves or serfs. In all of them, power was rigidly authoritarian. In all of
                              them, birth determined one's position in life. And hi all of

                              produced most of its own necessities.

                              There were exceptions—nothing is simple in history. There were
                              commercial cultures whose sailors crossed the seas, and highly
                              centralized kingdoms organized around giant irrigation systems. But
                              despite such differences, we are justified in seeing all these seemingly
                              distinctive civilizations as special cases of a single phenomenon:
                              agricultural civilization—the civilization spread by the First Wave.

                              During its dominance there were occasional hints of things to come.
                              There were embryonic mass-production factories in ancient Greece
                              and Rome. Oil was drilled on one of the Greek islands in 400 B.C. and
                              in Burma in A.D. 100. Vast bureaucracies flourished in Babylonia and
                              Egypt. Great urban metropolises grew up in Asia and South America.
                              There was money and exchange. Trade routes crisscrossed the
                              deserts, oceans, and mountains from Cathay to Calais. Corporations
                              and incipient nations existed. There was even, in ancient Alexandria, a
                              startling forerunner of the steam engine.

                              Yet nowhere was there anything that might remotely have been termed
                              an industrial civilization. These glimpses of the future, so to speak,
                              were mere oddities in history, scattered through different places and
                              periods. They never were brought together into a coherent system, nor
                              could they have been. Until 1650-1750, therefore, we can speak of a
                              First Wave world. Despite patches of primitivism and hints of the
                              industrial future, agricultural civilization dominated the planet and
                              seemed destined to do so forever.

                              This was the world in which the industrial revolution erupted, launching
                              the Second Wave and creating a strange, powerful, feverishly
                              energetic countercivilization. Industrialism was more than smokestacks
                              and assembly lines. It was a rich, many-sided social system that
                              touched every aspect of human life and attacked every feature of the
                              First Wave past. It produced the great Willow Run factory outside
                              Detroit, but it also put the tractor on the farm, the typewriter in the
                              office, the refrigerator in the kitchen. It produced the daily newspaper
                              and the cinema, the subway and the DC-3. It gave us cubism and
                              twelve-tone music. It gave us Bauhaus buildings and Barcelona chairs,
                              sit-down strikes, vitamin pills, and lengthened life spans. It
                              universalized the wristwatch and the ballot box. More important, it
                              linked all these things together—assembled them, like a machine—to
                              form the most

                              THE VIOLENT SOLUTION

                              As the Second Wave moved across various societies it touched off a
                              bloody, protracted war between the defenders of the agricultural past
                              and the partisans of the industrial future. The forces of First and]]></page><page Index="21"><![CDATA[Second Wave collided head-on, brushing aside, often decimating, the
                              "primitive" peoples encountered along the way.

                              In the United States, this collision began with the arrival of the
                              Europeans bent on establishing an agricultural, First Wave civilization.
                              A white agricultural tide pushed relentlessly westward, dispossessing
                              the Indian, depositing farms and agricultural villages farther and farther
                              toward the Pacific.

                              But hard on the heels of the farmers came the earliest in-dustrializers
                              as well, agents of the Second Wave future. Factories and cities began
                              to spring up in New England and the mid-Atlantic states. By the middle
                              of the nineteenth century, the Northeast had a rapidly growing
                              industrial sector producing firearms, watches, farm implements,
                              textiles, sewing machines, and other goods, while the rest of the
                              continent was still ruled by agricultural interests. Economic and social
                              tensions between First Wave and Second Wave forces grew in
                              intensity until 1861, when they broke into armed violence.

                              The Civil War was not fought exclusively, as it seemed to many, over
                              the moral issue of slavery or such narrow economic issues as tariffs. It
                              was fought over a much larger question: would the rich new continent
                              be ruled by farmers or industrializers, by the forces of the First Wave or
                              the Second? Would the future American society be basically
                              agricultural or industrial? When the Northern armies won, the die was
                              cast. The industrialization of the United States was assured. From that
                              time on, in economics, in politics, in social and cultural life, agriculture
                              was in retreat, industry ascendant. The First Wave ebbed as the
                              Second came thundering in.

                              The same collision of civilizations erupted elsewhere as well. In Japan
                              the Meiji Restoration, beginning in 1868, re-played in. unmistakably
                              Japanese terms the same struggle be-tween agricultural past and
                              industrial future. The abolition of feudalism by 1876, the rebellion of the
                              Satsuma clan in 1877,

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              the adoption of a Western-style constitution in 1889, were all
                              reflections of the collision of the First and Second Waves in Japan—
                              steps on the road to Japan's emergence as a premier industrial power.

                              In Russia, too, the same collision between First and Second Wave
                              forces erupted. The 1917 revolution was Russia's version of the
                              American Civil War. It was fought not primarily, as it seemed, over
                              communism but once again over the issue of industrialization. When
                              the Bolsheviks wiped out the last lingering vestiges of serfdom and
                              feudal monarchy, they pushed agriculture into the background and
                              consciously accelerated industrialism. They became the party of the
                              Second Wave.

                              In country after country, the same clash between First Wave and
                              Second Wave interests broke out, leading to political crisis and
                              upheavals, to strikes, uprisings, coups d'etat, and wars. By the mid-]]></page><page Index="22"><![CDATA[twentieth century, however, the forces of the First Wave were broken
                              and the Second Wave civilization reigned over the earth.

                              Today an industrial belt girdles the globe between the twenty-fifth and
                              sixty-fifth parallels in the Northern Hemisphere. In North America,
                              some 250 million people live an industrial way of life. In Western
                              Europe, from Scandinavia south to Italy, another quarter of a billion
                              humans live under industrialism. Eastward lies the "Eurassian"
                              industrial region—Eastern Europe and the western part of the Soviet
                              Union—and there we find still another quarter of a billion people living
                              out their lives in industrial societies. Finally, we come to the Asian
                              industrial region, comprising Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan,
                              Australia, New Zealand, and parts of South Korea and the Chinese
                              mainland, and yet another quarter billion industrial people. In all,
                              industrial civilization embraces roughly one billion human beings—one
                              fourth the population of the globe.*

                              Despite dizzying differences of language, culture, history, and

                              lures. Indeed, beneath the well-known differences lies a hidden
                              bedrock of similarity.

                              And to understand today's colliding waves of change wo must be able
                              to identify clearly the parallel structures of all industrial nations—the
                              hidden framework of Second Wave civilization. For it is this industrial
                              framework itself that is now being shattered.

                              LIVING BATTERIES

                              The precondition of any civilization, old or new, is energy. First Wave
                              societies drew their energy from "living batteries"—human and animal
                              muscle-power—or from sun, wind, and water. Forests were cut for
                              cooking and heating. Waterwheels, some of them using tidal power,
                              turned millstones. Windmills creaked in the fields. Animals pulled the
                              plow. As late as the French Revolution, it has been estimated, Europe
                              drew energy from an estimated 14 million horses and 24 million oxen.
                              All First Wave societies thus exploited energy sources that were
                              renewable. Nature could eventually replenish the forests they cut, the
                              wind that filled their sails, the rivers that turned then* paddle wheels.
                              Even animals and people were replaceable "energy slaves.*'

                              All Second Wave societies, by contrast, began to draw their energy
                              from coal, gas, and oil—from irreplaceable fossil fuels. This]]></page><page Index="23"><![CDATA[revolutionary shift, coming after Newcomen invented a workable steam
                              engine in 1712, meant that for the first time a civilization was eating
                              into nature's capital rather than merely living off the interest it provided.

                              This dipping into the earth's energy reserves provided a hidden
                              subsidy for industrial civilization, vastly accelerating its economic
                              growth. And from that day to this, wherever the Second Wave passed,
                              nations built towering technological and economic structures on the
                              assumption that cheap fossil fuels would be endlessly available. In
                              capitalist and communist industrial societies alike, in East and West,
                              this same shift has been apparent—from dispersed to concentrated
                              energy, from renewable to non-renewable, from many different sources
                              and fuels to a few. Fossil fuels formed the energy base of all Second
                              Wave societies.

                              26 THE THIRD WAVE

                              THE TECHNOLOGICAL WOMB

                              The leap to a new energy system was paralleled by a gigantic advance
                              in technology. First Wave societies had relied on what Vitruvius, two
                              thousand years ago, called "necessary inventions." But these early
                              winches and wedges, catapults, winepresses, levers, and hoists were
                              chiefly used to amplify human or animal muscles.

                              The Second Wave pushed technology to a totally new level. It
                              spawned gigantic electromechanical machines, moving parts, belts,
                              hoses, bearings, and bolts—all clattering and ratcheting along. And
                              these new machines did more than augment raw muscle. Industrial
                              civilization gave technology sensory organs, creating machines that
                              could hear, see, and touch with greater accuracy and precision than
                              human beings. It gave technology a womb, by inventing machines
                              designed to give birth to new machines in infinite progression—i.e.,
                              machine tools. More important, it brought machines together in
                              interconnected systems under a single roof, to create the factory and
                              ultimately the assembly line within the factory.

                              On this technological base a host of industries sprang up to give
                              Second Wave civilization its defining stamp. At first there were coal,
                              textiles, and railroads, then steel, auto manufacture, aluminum,
                              chemicals, and appliances. Huge factory cities leaped into existence:
                              Lille and Manchester for textiles, Detroit for automobiles, Essen and—
                              later—Magnitogorsk for steel, and a hundred others as well.

                              From these industrial centers poured millions upon endless millions of
                              identical products—shirts, shoes, automobiles, watches, toys, soap,
                              shampoo, cameras, machine guns, and electric motors. The new
                              technology powered by the new energy system opened the door to
                              mass production.

                              THE VERMILION PAGODA

                              Mass production, however, was meaningless, without parallel changes
                              in the distribution system. In First Wave societies, goods were normally
                              made by handcraft methods. Products were created one at a time on a

                              feudal order in the West. These companies opened trade routes
                              around the world, organized convoys of ships and camel caravans.
                              They sold glass, paper, silk, nutmeg, tea, wine and wool, indigo and
                              mace.

                              Most of these products, however, reached consumers through tiny
                              stores or on the backs and wagons of peddlers who fanned out into the
                              countryside. Wretched communications and primitive transport
                              drastically circumscribed the market. These small-scale shopkeepers
                              and itinerant vendors could offer only the slenderest of inventories, and
                              often they were out of this or that item for months, even years, at a
                              time.

                              The Second Wave wrought changes in this creaking, overburdened
                              distribution system that were as radical, in their ways, as the more
                              publicized advances made in production. Railroads, highways, and
                              canals opened up the hinterlands, and with industrialism came
                              "palaces of trade**—the first department stores. Complex networks of
                              jobbers, wholesalers, commission agents, and manufacturers*
                              representatives sprang up, and in 1871 George Huntington Hartford,
                              whose first store hi New York was painted vermilion and had a
                              cashier's cage shaped like a Chinese pagoda, did for distribution what
                              Henry Ford later did for the factory. He advanced it to an entirely new
                              stage by creating the world's first mammoth chain-store system—The
                              Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company.

                              Custom distribution gave way to the mass distribution and mass
                              merchandising that became as familiar and central a component of all
                              industrial societies as the machine itself.

                              What we see, therefore, if we take these changes together, is a
                              transformation of what might be called the "techno-sphere." All
                              societies—primitive, agricultural, or industrial— use energy; they make
                              things; they distribute things. In all societies the energy system, the
                              production system, and the distribution system are interrelated parts of
                              something larger. This larger system is the techno-sphere, and it has a
                              characteristic form at each stage of social development

                              As the Second Wave swept across the planet, the agricultural techno-
                              sphere was replaced by an industrial techno-sphere: non-renewable
                              energies were directly plugged into a mass production system which,
                              in turn, spewed goods into a highly developed mass distribution
                              system.

                              THE STREAMLINED FAMILY]]></page><page Index="25"><![CDATA[This Second Wave techno-sphere, however, needed an equally
                              revolutionary "socio-sphere" to accommodate it. It needed radically
                              new forms of social organization.

                              Before the industrial revolution, for example, family forms varied from
                              place to place. But wherever agriculture held sway, people tended to
                              live in large, multigenerational households, with uncles, aunts, in-laws,
                              grandparents, or cousins all living under the same roof, all working
                              together as an economic production unit—from the "joint family" in
                              India to the "zadruga" in the Balkans and the "extended family" in
                              Western Europe. And the family was immobile—rooted to the soil.

                              As the Second Wave began to move across First Wave societies,
                              families felt the stress of change. Within each household the collision
                              of wave fronts took the form of conflict, attacks on patriarchal authority,
                              altered relationships between children and parents, new notions of
                              propriety. As economic production shifted from the field to the factory,
                              the family no longer worked together as a unit. To free workers for
                              factory labor, key functions of the family were parceled out to new,
                              specialized institutions. Education of the child was turned over to
                              schools. Care of the aged was turned over to poor-houses or old-age
                              homes or nursing homes. Above all, the new society required mobility.
                              It needed workers who would follow jobs from place to place.

                              Burdened with elderly relatives, the sick, the handicapped, and a large
                              brood of children, the extended family was anything but mobile.
                              Gradually and painfully, therefore, family structure began to change.
                              Tom apart by the migration to the cities, battered by economic storms,
                              families stripped themselves of unwanted relatives, grew smaller, more
                              mobile, and more suited to the needs of the new techno-sphere.

                              The so-called nuclear family—father, mother, and a few children, with
                              no encumbering relatives—became the standard, socially approved,
                              "modern" model in all industrial societies, whether capitalist or socialist.
                              Even in Japan, where ancestor worship gave the elderly an
                              exceptionally important role, the large, close-knit, multigenerational
                              household began to break down as the Second Wave advanced. More
                              and more nuclear units appeared. In short, the nuclear family became
                              an identifiable feature of all Second Wave societies,

                              THE ARCHITECTURE OF CIVILIZATION 29

                              marking them off from First Wave societies just as surely as fossil
                              fuels, steel mills, or chain stores.

                              THE COVERT CURRICULUM

                              As work shifted out of the fields and the home, moreover, children had
                              to be prepared for factory life. The early mine, mill, and factory owners
                              of industrializing England discovered, as Andrew Ure wrote in 1835,
                              that it was "nearly impossible to convert persons past the age of
                              puberty, whether drawn from rural or from handicraft occupations, into
                              useful factory hands." If young people could be prefitted to the
                              industrial system, it would vastly ease the problems of industrial
                              discipline later on. The result was another central structure of all
                              Second Wave societies: mass education.]]></page><page Index="26"><![CDATA[Built on the factory model, mass education taught basic reading,
                              writing, and arithmetic, a bit of history and other subjects. This was the
                              "overt curriculum." But beneath it lay an invisible or "covert curriculum"
                              that was far more basic. It consisted—and still does in most industrial
                              nations—of three courses: one in punctuality, one in obedience, and
                              one in rote, repetitive work. Factory labor demanded workers who
                              showed up on time, especially assembly-line hands. It demanded
                              workers who would take orders from a management hierarchy without
                              questioning. And it demanded men and women prepared to slave
                              away at machines or in offices, performing brutally repetitious
                              operations.

                              Thus from the mid-nineteenth century on, as the Second Wave cut
                              across country after country, one found a relentless educational
                              progression: children started school at a younger and younger age, the
                              school year became longer and longer (in the United States it climbed
                              35 percent between 1878 and 1956), and the number of years of
                              compulsory schooling irresistibly increased.

                              Mass public education was clearly a humanizing step for-ward. As a
                              group of mechanics and workingmen in New York City declared in
                              1829, "Next to life and liberty, we consider education the greatest
                              blessing bestowed upon mankind." Nevertheless, Second Wave
                              schools machined generation after generation of young people into a
                              pliable, regimented work force of the type required by
                              electromechanical technology and the assembly line.

                              Taken together, the nuclear family and the factory-si

                              school formed part of a single integrated system for the preparation of
                              young people for roles in industrial society. In this respect, too, Second
                              Wave societies, capitalist or communist, North or South, were all alike.

                              IMMORTAL BEINGS

                              In all Second Wave societies a third institution arose that extended the
                              social control of the first two. This was the invention known as the
                              corporation. Until then, the typical business enterprise had been owned
                              by an individual, a family, or a partnership. Corporations existed, but
                              were extremely rare.

                              Even as late as the American Revolution, according to business
                              historian Arthur Dewing, "no one could have concluded" that the
                              corporation—rather 4han the partnership or individual proprietorship—
                              would become the main organizational form. As recently as 1800 there
                              were only 335 corporations in the United States, most of them devoted
                              to such quasi-public activities as building canals or running turnpikes.

                              The rise of mass production changed all this. Second Wave
                              technologies required giant pools of capital—more than a single
                              individual or even a small group could provide. So long as proprietors
                              or partners risked their entire personal fortunes with every investment,
                              they were reluctant to sink their money in vast or risky ventures. To]]></page><page Index="27"><![CDATA[encourage them, the concept of limited liability was introduced. If a
                              corporation collapsed, the investor stood to lose only the sum invested
                              and no more. This innovation opened the investment floodgates.

                              Moreover, the corporation was treated by the courts as an "immortal
                              being"—meaning it could outlive its original investors. This meant, in
                              turn, that it could make very long-range plans and undertake far bigger
                              projects than ever before.

                              By 1901 the world's first billion-dollar corporation—United States
                              Steel—appeared on the scene, a concentration of assets unimaginable
                              in any earlier period. By 1919 there were half a dozen such
                              behemoths. Indeed, large corporations became an in-built feature of
                              economic life in all the industrial nations, including socialist and
                              communist societies, where the form varied but the substance (in
                              terms of organization) remained very much the same. Together these
                              three—the nuclear family, the factory-style school, and the giant
                              corporation—

                              THE ARCHITECTURE OF CIVILIZATION 31

                              became the defining social institutions of all Second Wave societies.

                              And, throughout the Second Wave world—in Japan as well as in
                              Switzerland, Britain, Poland, the U.S., and the U.S.S.R.—most people
                              followed a standard life trajectory: reared in a nuclear family, they
                              moved en masse through fac torylike schools, then entered the service
                              of a large corporation, private or public. A key Second Wave institution
                              dominated each phase of the life-style.

                              THE MUSIC FACTORY

                              Around these three core institutions a host of other organizations
                              sprang up. Government ministries, sports clubs, churches, chambers
                              of commerce, trade unions, professional organizations, political parties,
                              libraries, ethnic associations, recreational groups, and thousands of
                              others bobbed up in the wake of the Second Wave, creating a
                              complicated organizational ecology with each group servicing,
                              coordinating, or counterbalancing another.

                              At first glance, the variety of these groups suggests randomness or
                              chaos. But a closer look reveals a hidden pattern. In one Second Wave
                              country after another, social inventors, believing the factory to be the
                              most advanced and efficient agency for production, tried to embody its
                              principles in other organizations as well. Schools, hospitals, prisons,
                              government bureaucracies, and other organizations thus took on many
                              of the characteristics of the factory—its division of labor, its hierarchical
                              structure and its metallic impersonality.

                              Even in the arts we find some of the principles of the factory. Instead of
                              working for a patron, as was customary during the long reign of
                              agricultural civilization, musicians, artists, composers, and writers were
                              increasingly thrown on the mercies of the marketplace. More and more
                              they turned out "products" for anonymous consumers. And as this shift
                              occurred in every Second Wave country, the very structure of artistic
                              production changed.]]></page><page Index="28"><![CDATA[Music provides a striking example. As the Second Wave arrived,

                              he could make. Hence more and more seats were added. In turn,
                              however, larger concert halls required louder sounds— music that
                              could be clearly heard in the very last tier. The result was a shift from
                              chamber music to symphonic forms.

                              Says Curt Sachs in his authoritative History of Musical Instruments,
                              "The passage from an aristocratic to a democratic culture, in the
                              eighteenth century, replaced the small salons by the more and more
                              gigantic concert halls, which demanded greater volume." Since no
                              technology existed yet to make this possible, more and more
                              instruments and players were added to produce the necessary volume.
                              The result was the modern symphony orchestra, and it was for this
                              industrial institution that Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Schubert, and
                              Brahms wrote their magnificent symphonies.

                              The orchestra even mirrored certain features of the factory in its
                              internal structure. At first the symphony orchestra was leaderless, or
                              the leadership was casually passed around among the players. Later
                              the players, exactly like workers in a factory or bureaucratic office,
                              were divided into departments (instramental sections), each
                              contributing to the overall output (the music), each coordinated from
                              above by a manager (the conductor) or even, eventually, a straw boss
                              farther down the management hierarchy (the first violinist or the section
                              head). The institution sold its product to a mass market—eventually
                              adding phonograph records to its output. The music factory had been
                              born.

                              The history of the orchestra offers only one illustration of the way the
                              Second Wave socio-sphere arose, with its three core institutions and
                              thousands of varied organizations, all adapted to the needs and style
                              of the industrial techno-sphere. But a civilization is more than simply a
                              techno-sphere and a matching socio-sphere. All civilizations also
                              require an "info-sphere" for producing and distributing information, and
                              here, too, the changes brought by the Second Wave were remarkable.

                              THE PAPER BLIZZARD

                              All human groups, from primitive times to today, depend on face-to-
                              face, person-to-person communication. But systems were needed for
                              sending messages across time and space as well. The ancient
                              Persians are said to have set up towers or "call-posts," placing men
                              with shrill, loud voices atop them to]]></page><page Index="29"><![CDATA[THE ARCHITECTURE OF CIVILIZATION 33

                              relay messages by shouting from one tower to the next. The Romans
                              operated an extensive messenger service called the cursus publicus.
                              Between 1305 and the early 1800's, the House of Taxis ran a form of
                              pony express service all over Europe. By 1628 it employed twenty
                              thousand men. Its couriers, clad in blue and silver uniforms,
                              crisscrossed the continent carrying messages between princes and
                              generals, merchants and money lenders.

                              During First Wave civilization all these channels were reserved for the
                              rich and powerful only. Ordinary people had no access to them. As the
                              historian Laurin Zilliacus states, even "attempts to send letters by other
                              means were looked upon with suspicion or . . . forbidden" by the
                              authorities. In short, while face-to-face information exchange was open
                              to all, the newer systems used for carrying imformation beyond the
                              confines of a family or a village were essentially closed and used for
                              purposes of social or political control. They were, in effect, weapons of
                              the elite.

                              The Second Wave, as it moved across country after country, smashed
                              this communications monopoly. This occurred not because the rich
                              and powerful grew suddenly altruistic but because Second Wave
                              technology and factory mass production required "mass-ive"
                              movements of information that the old channels simply could no longer
                              handle.

                              The information needed for economic production in primitive and First
                              Wave societies is comparatively simple and usually available from
                              someone near at hand. It is mostly oral or gestural hi form. Second
                              Wave economies, by contrast, required the tight coordination of work
                              done at many locations. Not only raw materials but great amounts of
                              information had to be produced and carefully distributed.

                              For this reason, as the Second Wave gained momentum every country
                              raced to build a postal service. The post'office was an invention quite
                              as imaginative and socially useful as the cotton gin or the spinning
                              jenny and, to an extent forgotten today, it elicited rhapsodic
                              enthusiasm. The American orator Edward Everett declared: "I am
                              compelled to regard the Post-office, next to Christianity, as the right
                              arm of our modern civilization."

                              For the post office provided the first wide open channel for industrial-
                              era communications. By 1837 the British Post Office was carrying not
                              merely messages for an elite but some 88 million pieces of mail a
                              year—an avalanche of commnm.., tions by the standards of the day.

                              the industrial era peaked and the Third Wave began its surge, that
                              number had already climbed to 10 billion. That same year the U.S.
                              Post Office was distributing 355 pieces of domestic mail for every man,
                              woman, and child in the nation.*]]></page><page Index="30"><![CDATA[The surge in postal messages that accompanied the industrial
                              revolution merely hints, however, at the real volume of information that
                              began to flow in the wake of the Second Wave. An even greater
                              number of messages poured through what might be called "micro-
                              postal systems" within large organizations. Memos are letters that
                              never reach the public communications channels. In 1955, as the
                              Second Wave crested in the United States, the Hoover Commission
                              peeked inside the files of three major corporations. It discovered,
                              respectively, thirty-four thousand, fifty-six thousand, and sixty-four
                              thousand documents and memos on file for each employee on the
                              payroll!

                              Nor could the mushrooming informational needs of industrial societies
                              be met in writing alone. Thus the telephone and telegraph were
                              invented hi the nineteenth century to carry then: share of the ever-
                              swelling communications load. By 1960 Americans were placing some
                              256 million phone calls per day—over 93 billion a year—and even the
                              most advanced telephone systems and networks in the world were
                              often overloaded.

                              All these were essentially systems for delivering messages from one
                              sender to one receiver at a time. But a society developing mass
                              production and mass consumption needed ways to send mass
                              messages, too—communications from one sender to many receivers
                              simultaneously. Unlike the preindus-trial employer, who could
                              personally visit each of his handful of employees in their own homes if
                              need be, the industrial employer could not communicate with his
                              thousands of workers on a one-by-one basis. Still less could the mass
                              merchandiser or distributor communicate with his customers one by
                              one. Second Wave society needed—and not surprisingly invented —
                              powerful means for sending the same message to many people at
                              once, cheaply, rapidly, and reliably. ,

                              Postal services could carry the same message to millions—but not
                              quickly. Telephones could carry messages quickly—

                              * The amount of mail provides a good, instant index to the level of
                              traditional industrialization in any country. For Second Wave societies,
                              the average hi 1960 was 141 pieces of mail per person. By contrast, in
                              First Wave societies the level was barely a tenth of that—twelve per
                              person per year in Malaysia or Ghana, four per year in Colombia.

                              35

                              but not to millions of people simultaneously. This gap came to be filled
                              by the mass media.

                              Today, of course, the mass circulation newspaper and magazine are
                              so standard a part of daily life in every one of the industrial nations that
                              they are taken for granted. Yet the rise of these publications on a
                              national level reflected the convergent development of many new
                              industrial technologies and social forms. Thus, writes Jean-Louis
                              Servan-Schreiber, they were made possible by the coming together of]]></page><page Index="31"><![CDATA["trains to transport the publications throughout a [European-size]
                              country in a single day; rotary presses capable of turning out dozens of

                              telephones ... above all a public taught to read by compulsory
                              education, and industries needing to mass distribute their products." ,

                              In the mass media, from newspapers and radio to movies and
                              television, we find once again an embodiment of the basic principle of
                              the factory. All of them stamp identical messages into millions of
                              brains, just as the factory stamps out identical products for use in
                              millions of homes. Standardized, mass-manufactured "facts,"
                              counterparts of standardized, mass-manufactured products, flow from
                              a few concentrated image-factories out to millions of consumers.
                              Without this vast, powerful system for channeling information, industrial
                              civilization could not have taken form or functioned reliably.

                              Thus there sprang up in all industrial societies, capitalist and socialist
                              alike, an elaborate info-sphere—communication channels through
                              which individual and mass messages could be distributed as efficiently
                              as goods or raw materials. This info-sphere intertwined with and
                              serviced the techno-sphere and the socio-sphere, helping to integrate
                              economic production with private behavior.

                              Each of these spheres performed a key function in the larger system,
                              and could not have existed without the others. The techno-sphere
                              produced and allocated wealth; the socio-sphere, with its thousands of
                              interrelated organizations, allocated roles to individuals in the system.
                              And the info-sphere , allocated the information necessary to make the
                              entire system work. Together they formed the basic architecture of
                              society.

                              We see here in outline, therefore, the common structures of all Second
                              Wave nations—regardless of their cultural or climatic differences,
                              regardless of their ethnic and religious

                              communist.

                              These parallel structures, as basic in the Soviet Union and Hungary as
                              in West Germany, France, or Canada, set the limits within which
                              political, social, and cultural differences were expressed. They
                              emerged everywhere only after bitter political, cultural, and economic
                              battles between those who attempted to preserve the older First Wave
                              structures and those who recognized that only a new civilization could
                              solve the painful problems of the old.

                              The Second Wave brought with it a fantastic extension of human hope.
                              For the first time men and women dared to believe that poverty,
                              hunger, disease, and tyranny might be overthrown. Utopian writers and
                              philosophers, from Abbe Morelly and Robert Owen to Saint-Simon,
                              Fourier, Proudhon, Louis Blanc, Edward Bellamy, and scores of others,
                              saw in the emerging industrial civilization the potential for introducing]]></page><page Index="32"><![CDATA[peace, harmony, employment for all, equality of wealth or of

                              thousands of years of primitive existence and the thousands of years
                              of agricultural civilization.

                              If today industrial civilization seems to us something less than

                              precarious, war-prone, and psychologically repressive—-we need to
                              understand why. We will be able to answer this question only if we look
                              at the gigantic wedge that split the Second Wave psyche into two
                              warring parts.

                              apart two aspects of our lives that had always, until then, been one. In
                              so doing, it drove a giant invisible wedge into our economy, our
                              psyches, and even our sexual selves.

                              At one level, the industrial revolution created a mar-velously integrated
                              social system with its own distinctive technologies, its own social
                              institutions, and its own information channels—all plugged tightly into
                              each other. Yet, at another level, it ripped apart the underlying unity of
                              society, creating a way of life filled with economic tension, social
                              conflict, and psychological malaise. Only if we understand how this
                              invisible wedge has shaped our lives throughout the Second Wave era
                              can we appreciate the full impact of the Third Wave that is beginning to
                              reshape us today.

                              The two halves of human life that the Second Wave split apart were
                              production and consumption. We are accustomed, for example, to
                              think of ourselves as producers or consumers. This wasn't always true.
                              Until the industrial revolution, the vast bulk of all the food, goods, and
                              services produced by the human race was consumed by the producers
                              themselves, their families, or a tiny elite who managed to scrape off the
                              surplus for their own use.

                              In most agricultural societies the great majority of people were
                              peasants who huddled together in small, semi-isolated communities.
                              They lived on a subsistence diet, growing just barely enough to keep
                              themselves alive and their masters happy. Lacking the means for
                              storing food over long periods,

                              lacking the roads necessary to transport their product to distant
                              markets, and well aware that any increase in output was likely to be
                              confiscated by the slave-owner or feudal lord, they also lacked any
                              great incentive to improve technology or increase production.]]></page><page Index="33"><![CDATA[Commerce existed, of course. We know that small numbers of intrepid
                              merchants carried goods for thousands of miles by camel, wagon, or
                              boat We know that cities sprang up dependent on food from the
                              countryside. By 1519, when the Spaniards arrived in Mexico, they were
                              astonished to find thousands of people in Tlatelolco engaged in buying
                              and selling jewels, precious metals, slaves and sandals, cloth,
                              chocolate, ropes, skins, turkeys, vegetables, rabbits, dogs, and pottery
                              of a thousand kinds. The Fugger Newsletter, private dispatches
                              prepared for German bankers in the sixteenth and seventeenth
                              centuries, give colorful evidence of the scope of trade by that time. A
                              letter from Cochin, in India, describes in detail the trials of a European
                              merchant who arrived with five ships to buy pepper for transport to
                              Europe. "A pepper store is fine business," he explains, "but it requires
                              great zeal and perseverance." This merchant also shipped cloves,
                              nutmeg, flour, cinnamon, mace, and various drugs to the European
                              market.

                              Nevertheless, all this commerce represented only a trace element in
                              history, compared with the extent of production for immediate self-use
                              by the agricultural slave or serf. Even as late as the sixteenth century,
                              according to Fernand Braudel, whose historical research on the period
                              is unsurpassed, the entire Mediterranean region—from France and
                              Spain at one end to Turkey at the other—supported a population of
                              sixty to seventy million, of which 90 percent lived on the soil, producing
                              only a small amount of goods for trade. Writes Braudel, "60 percent or
                              perhaps 70 percent of the overall production of the Mediterranean
                              never entered the market economy." And if this was the case in the
                              Mediterranean region, what should we assume of Northern Europe,
                              where the rocky soil and long cold winters made it even more difficult
                              for peasants to extract a surplus from the soil?

                              It will help us understand the Third Wave if we conceive of the First
                              Wave economy, before the industrial revolution, as consisting of two
                              sectors. In Sector A, people produced for their own use. In Sector B,
                              they produced for trade or exchange. Sector A was huge; Sector B
                              was tiny. For most

                              between the two. They lacked even n w«>i.i for consumer. Throughout
                              the First Wave era only n liny fraction of the population was dependent
                              on the maikri; most people lived largely outside it. In the words of the hi
                              sic i-rian R. H. Tawney, "pecuniary transactions were a fringe on a
                              world of natural economy."

                              The Second Wave violently changed this situation. Instead of
                              essentially self-sufficient people and communities, it created for the
                              first time in history a situation in which the overwhelming bulk of all
                              food, goods, and services was destined for sale, barter, or exchange. It
                              virtually wiped out of existence goods produced for one's own
                              consumption—for use by the actual producer and his or her family—
                              and created a civilization in which almost no one, not even a farmer,]]></page><page Index="34"><![CDATA[was self-sufficient any longer. Everyone became almost totally
                              dependent upon food, goods, or services produced by somebody else.

                              In short, industrialism broke the union of production and consumption,
                              and split the producer from the consumer. The fused economy of the
                              First Wave was transformed into the split economy of the Second
                              Wave.

                              THE MEANING OF THE MARKET

                              The consequences of this fission were momentous. Even now we
                              scarcely understand them. First, the marketplace— once a minor and
                              peripheral phenomenon—moved into the very vortex of life. The
                              economy became "marketized" And this happened in both capitalist
                              and socialist industrial economies.

                              Western economists tend to think of the market as a purely capitalist
                              fact of life and often use the term as though it were synonymous with
                              "profit economy." Yet from all we know of history, exchange—and
                              hence a marketplace—sprang up earlier than, and independently of,
                              profit. For the market, properly speaking, is nothing more than an
                              exchange network, a switchboard, as it were, through which goods or
                              services, like messages, are routed to their appropriate destinations. It
                              is not inherently capitalist. Such a switchboard

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              is just as essential to a socialist industrial society as it is to profit-
                              motivated industrialism.*

                              In short, wherever the Second Wave struck and the purpose of
                              production shifted from use to exchange, there had to be a mechanism
                              through which that exchange could take place. There had to be a
                              market. But the market was not passive. The economic historian Karl
                              Polanyi has shown how the market, which was subordinated to the
                              social or religio-cul-tural goals of early societies, came to set the goals
                              of industrial societies. Most people were sucked into the money
                              system. Commercial values became central, economic growth (as
                              measured by the size of the market) became the primary goal of
                              governments, whether capitalist or socialist.

                              For the market was an expansive, self-reinforcing institution. Just as
                              the earliest division of labor had encouraged commerce in the first
                              place, now the very existence of a market or switchboard encouraged
                              a further division of labor and led to sharply increased productivity. A
                              self-amplifying process had been set in motion.

                              This explosive expansion of the market contributed to the fastest rise in
                              living standards the world had ever experienced.

                              In politics, however, Second Wave governments found themselves
                              increasingly torn by a new kind of conflict born of the split between
                              production and consumption. The Marxist emphasis on class struggle
                              has systematically obscured the larger, deeper conflict that arose]]></page><page Index="35"><![CDATA[between the demands of producers (both workers and managers) for
                              higher wages, profits, and benefits and the counter-demand of
                              consumers

                              * The market as a switchboard must exist whether trade is based on
                              money or barter. It must exist whether or not profit is siphoned out of it,
                              whether prices follow supply and demand or are fixed by the state,
                              whether the system is planned or not, whether the means of production
                              are private or public. It must exist even in a hypothetical economy of
                              self-managed industrial firms in which workers set their own wages
                              high enough to eliminate profit as a category.

                              So overlooked is this essential fact, so closely has the market been
                              identified with only one of its many variants (the profit-based, private-
                              property model, in which prices reflect supply and demand), that there
                              is not even a word in the conventional vocabulary of economics to
                              express the multiplicity of its forms.

                              Throughout these pages, the term "market" is used in its full generic
                              sense, rather than hi the customary restrictive way. Semantics aside,
                              however, the basic point remains: wherever producer and consumer
                              are divorced, some mechanism is needed to mediate between them.
                              This mechanism, whatever its form, is what I call the market.

                              THE INVISIBLE WEDGE

                              (including the very same people) for lower prices. The seesaw of
                              economic policy rocked on this fulcrum.

                              The growth of the consumer movement in the United States, the recent
                              uprisings in Poland against government-decreed price hikes, the
                              endlessly raging debate in Britain about prices and incomes policy, the
                              deadly ideological (struggles in the Soviet Union over whether heavy
                              industry or consumer goods should receive first priority, are all aspects
                              of the profound conflict engendered in any society, capitalist or
                              socialist, by the split between production and consumption.

                              Not only politics but culture, too, was shaped by this cleavage, for it
                              also produced the most money-minded, grasping, commercialized, and
                              calculating civilization in history. One need scarcely be a Marxist to
                              agree with The Communist Manifesto's famous accusation that the
                              new society "left remaining no other nexus between man and man than
                              naked self-interest, than callous 'cash payment.'" Personal
                              relationships, family bonds, love, friendship, neighborly and community
                              ties all became tinctured or corrupted by commercial self-interest.

                              Correct in identifying this dehumanization of interpersonal bonds, Marx
                              was incorrect, however, in attributing it to capitalism. He wrote, of
                              course, at a time when the only industrial society he could observe was
                              capitalist hi form. Today, after more than half a century of experience
                              with industrial societies based on socialism, or at least state socialism,
                              we know that aggressive acquisitiveness, commercial corruption, and
                              the reduction of human relationships to coldly economic terms are no
                              monopoly of the profit system.]]></page><page Index="36"><![CDATA[For the obsessive concern with money, goods, and things is A

                              production is divorced from consumption, in which everyone is
                              dependent upon the marketplace rather than on his or her own

                              a new car or otherwise unobtainable goods.

                              Such corruption is inherent in the divorce of production from
                              consumption. The very need for a market or switchboard to reconnect
                              consumer and producer, to move goods from producer to consumer,
                              necessarily places those who control the market in a position of
                              inordinate power—regardless of the rhetoric they use to justify that
                              power.

                              This divorce of production from consumption, which became a defining
                              feature of all industrial or Second Wave societies, even affected our
                              psyches and our assumptions about personality. Behavior came to be
                              seen as a set of transactions. Instead of a society based on friendship,
                              kinship, or tribal or feudal allegiance, there arose in the wake of the
                              Second Wave a civilization based on contractual ties, actual or implied.
                              Even husbands and wives today speak of marital contracts.

                              The cleavage between these two roles—producer and consumer—
                              created at the same time a dual personality. The very same person
                              who (as a producer) was taught by family, school, and boss to defer
                              gratification, to be disciplined, controlled, restrained, obedient, to be a
                              team player, was simultaneously taught (as a consumer) to seek
                              instant gratification, to be hedonistic rather than calculating, to
                              abandon discipline, to pursue individualistic pleasure—in short, to be a
                              totally different kind of person. In the West especially, the full firepower
                              of advertising was trained on the consumer, urging her or him to
                              borrow, to buy on impulse, to "Fly now, pay later," and, in so doing, to
                              perform a -patriotic service by keeping the wheels of the economy
                              turning.

                              Finally, the same giant wedge that split producer from consumer in
                              Second Wave societies also split work into two kinds. This had an
                              enormous impact on family life, sexual roles, and on our inner lives as

                              lies not in some fixed biological reality but in the psychological effects
                              of the invisible wedge.

                              In First Wave societies most work was performed in the fields or in the
                              home, with the entire household toiling together as an economic unit
                              and with most production destined for consumption within the village or
                              manor. Work life and home life were fused and intermingled. And since
                              each village was largely self-sufficient, the success of the peasants in
                              one place was not dependent upon what happened in another. Even
                              within the production unit most workers performed a variety of tasks,
                              swapping and shifting roles as demanded by the season, by sickness,
                              or by choice. The pre-industrial division of labor was very primitive. As
                              a result, work in First Wave agricultural societies was characterized by
                              low levels of interdependency.

                              The Second Wave, washing across Britain, France, Germany, and
                              other countries, shifted work from field and home to factory, and
                              introduced a much higher level of interdependency. Work now
                              demanded collective effort, division of labor, coordination, the
                              integration of many different skills. Its success depended upon the
                              carefully scheduled cooperative behavior of thousands of far-flung
                              people, many of whom never laid eyes on one another. The failure of a
                              major steel mill or glass factory to deliver needed supplies to an auto
                              plant could, under certain circumstances, send repercussions
                              throughout a whole industry or regional economy.

                              The collision of low- and high-interdependency work produced severe
                              conflict over roles, responsibilities, and rewards. The early factory
                              owners, for example, complained that their workers were
                              irresponsible—that they cared little about the efficiency of the factory,
                              that they went fishing when most needed, engaged hi horseplay, or
                              turned up drunk. In- fact, most of the early industrial workers were rural
                              folk who were accustomed to low interdependency, and had little or no
                              understanding of their own role in the overall production process or of
                              the failures, breakdowns, and malfunctions occasioned by their
                              "irresponsibility." Moreover, since most of them earned pitiful wages,
                              they had little incentive to care.

                              In the clash between these two work systems, the new forms of work
                              seemed to triumph. More and more production was transferred to the
                              factory and office. The countryside was stripped of population. Millions
                              of workers became part of high-interdependence networks. Second

                              This victory of interdependence over self-sufficiency, however, was
                              never fully consummated. In one place the older form of work
                              stubbornly held on. This place was the home.

                              Each home remained a decentralized unit engaged in biological
                              reproduction, in child-rearing, and in cultural transmission. If one family
                              failed to reproduce, or did a poor job of rearing its children and
                              preparing them for life in the work system, its failures did not
                              necessarily endanger the accomplishment of those tasks by the family
                              next door. Housework remained, in other words, a low-
                              interdependency activity.

                              The housewife continued, as always, to perform a set of crucial
                              economic functions. She "produced." But she produced for Sector A—
                              for the use of her own family—not for the market.

                              As the husband, by and large, marched off to do the direct economic
                              work, the wife generally stayed behind to do the indirect economic
                              work. The man took responsibility for the historically more advanced
                              form of work; the woman was left behind to take care of the older,
                              more backward form of work. He moved, as it were, into the future; she
                              remained in the past.

                              This division produced a split in personality and inner life. The public or
                              collective nature of factory and office, the need for coordination and
                              integration, brought with it an emphasis on objective analysis and
                              objective relationships. Men, prepared from boyhood for their role in
                              the shop, where they would move in a world of interdependencies,
                              were encouraged to become "objective." Women, prepared from birth
                              for the tasks of reproduction, child-rearing, and household drudgery,
                              performed to a considerable degree in social isolation, were taught to
                              be "subjective"—and were frequently regarded as incapable of the kind
                              of rational, analytic thought that supposedly went with objectivity.

                              Not surprisingly, women who did leave the relative isolation of the
                              household to engage in interdependent production were often accused
                              of having been defeminized, of having grown cold, tough, and—
                              objective.

                              Sexual differences and sex role stereotypes, moreover, were
                              sharpened by the misleading identification of men with production and
                              women with consumption, even though men also consumed and
                              women also produced. In short, while women

                              earth, the modern "battle of the sexes" can be traced in large measure
                              to the conflict between two work-styles, and beyond that to the divorce
                              of production and con sumption. The split economy deepened the
                              sexual split as well.]]></page><page Index="39"><![CDATA[What we have seen so far, therefore, is that once the invisible wedge
                              was hammered into place, separating producer from consumer, a
                              number of profound changes followed: A market had to be formed or
                              expanded to connect the two; new political and social conflicts sprang
                              up; new sexual roles were defined. But the split implied far more than
                              this. It also meant that all Second Wave societies would have to
                              operate in similar fashion—that they would have to meet certain basic
                              requirements. Whether the object of production was profit or not,
                              whether the "means of production" were public or private, whether the
                              market was "free" or "planned," whether the rhetoric was capitalist or
                              socialist made no difference.

                              So long as production was intended for exchange, instead of use, so
                              long as it had to flow through the economic switchboard or market,
                              certain Second Wave principles had to be followed.

                              Once these principles are identified, the hidden dynamics of all
                              industrial societies are laid bare. Moreover, we can anticipate how
                              Second Wave people typically think. For these principles added up to
                              the basic rules, the behavioral code book, of Second Wave civilization.

                              BREAKING THE CODE

                              Every civilization has a hidden code—a set of rules or principles that
                              run through all its activities like a repeated design. As industrialism
                              pushed across the planet, its unique hidden design became visible. It
                              consisted of a set of six interrelated principles that programmed the
                              behavior of millions. Growing naturally out of the divorce of production
                              and consumption, these principles affected every aspect of life from
                              sex and sports to work and war.

                              Much of the angry conflict in our schools, businesses, and
                              governments today actually centers on these half-dozen principles, as
                              Second Wave people instinctively apply and defend them and Third
                              Wave people challenge and attack them. But that is getting ahead of
                              the story.

                              STANDARDIZATION

                              The most familiar of these Second Wave principles is standardization.
                              Everyone knows that industrial societies turn out millions of identical
                              products. Fewer people have stopped to notice, however, that once the
                              market became important, we did more than simply standardize Coca-
                              Cola bottles, light bulbs, and auto transmissions. We applied the same
                              principle to many other things. Among the first to grasp the importance
                              of this idea was Theodore Vail who, at the turn of the century, built the
                              American Telephone & Telegram Company into a giant*

                              *Not to be confused with the multinational ITT, the International
                              Telephone & Telegraph Corporation.

                              BREAKING THE CODE 47]]></page><page Index="40"><![CDATA[Working as a railway postal clerk in the late 1860's, Vail had noticed
                              that no two letters necessarily went to their destinations via the same
                              route. Sacks of mail traveled back and forth, often taking weeks or
                              months to reach their destinations. Vail introduced the idea of
                              standardized routing—all letters going to the same place would go the
                              same way—and helped revolutionize the post office. When he later
                              formed AT&T, he set out to place an identical telephone in every
                              American home.

                              Vail standardized not only the telephone handset and all its
                              components but AT&Ts business procedures and administration as
                              well. In a 1908 advertisement he justified his swallowing up small
                              telephone companies by arguing for "a clearing-house of
                              standardization" that would ensure economy in "construction of
                              equipment, lines and conduits, as well as hi operating methods and
                              legal work," not to mention "a uniform system of operating and
                              accounting." What Vail recognized is that to succeed in the Second
                              Wave environment, "software"—i.e., procedures and administrative
                              routines—had to be standardized along with hardware.

                              Vail was only one of the Great Standardizes who shaped industrial
                              society. Another was Frederick Winslow Taylor, a machinist turned
                              crusader, who believed that work could be made scientific by
                              standardizing the steps each worker performed. In the early decades
                              of this century Taylor decided that there was one best (standard) way
                              to perform each job, one best (standard) tool to perform it with, and a

                              Armed with this philosophy, he became the world's leading
                              management guru. In his time, and later, he was compared with Freud,
                              Marx, and Franklin. Nor were capitalist employers, eager to squeeze
                              the last ounce of productivity from their workers, alone in their
                              admiration for Taylorism, with its efficiency experts, piece-work
                              schemes, and rate-busters. Communists shared their enthusiasm.
                              Indeed, Lenin urged that Taylor's methods be adapted for use in
                              socialist production. An industrializer first and a Communist second,
                              Lenin, too, was a zealous believer hi standardization.

                              In Second Wave societies, hiring procedures as well as work were
                              increasingly standardized. Standardized tests were used to identify
                              and weed out the supposedly unfit, especially in the civil service. Pay
                              scales were Standardized throughout whole industries, along with
                              fringe benefits, lunch hours, holidays, and grievance procedures. To

                              Terman devised standardized intelligence tests. School grading
                              policies, admission procedures, and accreditation rules were similarly
                              standardized. The multiple-choice test came into its own.

                              The mass media, meanwhile, disseminated standardizing imagery, so

                              governments, combined with the influence of mass communications,
                              led to the near disappearance of local and regional dialects or even
                              whole languages, such as Welsh and Alsatian. "Standard" American,
                              English, French, or, for that matter, Russian, supplanted "nonstan-
                              dard" languages. Different parts of the country began to look alike, as
                              identical gas stations, billboards, and houses cropped up everywhere.
                              The principle of standardization ran through every aspect of daily life.

                              At an even deeper level, industrial civilization needed standardized
                              weights and measures. It is no accident that one of the first acts of the
                              French Revolution, which ushered the age of industrialism into France,
                              was an attempt to replace the crazy-quilt patchwork of measuring
                              units, common in preindustrial Europe, with the metric system and a
                              new calendar. Uniform measures were spread through much of the
                              world by the Second Wave.

                              Moreover, if mass production required the standardization of
                              machines, products, and processes, the ever-expanding market
                              demanded a corresponding standardization of money, and even
                              prices. Historically, money had been issued by banks and private
                              individuals as well as by kings. Even as late as the nineteenth century
                              privately minted money was still in use in parts of the United States,
                              and the practice lasted until 1935 hi Canada. Gradually, however,
                              industrializing nations suppressed all nongovernmental currencies and
                              managed to impose a single standard currency in their place.

                              Until the nineteenth century, moreover, it was still common for buyers
                              and sellers hi industrial countries to haggle over every sale in the time-
                              honored fashion of a Cairo bazaar. In 1825 a young Northern Irish
                              immigrant named A. T. Stewart arrived in New York, opened a dry-
                              goods store, and shocked customers and competitors alike by
                              introducing a fixed price for every item. This one-price policy—price
                              standardization—made Stewart one of the merchant princes of his

                              mass distribution.

                              Whatever their other disagreements, advanced Second Wave thinkers
                              shared the conviction that standardization was efficient. At many
                              levels, therefore, the Second Wave brought a flattening out of
                              differences through a relentless application of the principle of
                              standardization.

                              SPECIALIZATION

                              A second great principle ran through all Second Wave societies:
                              specialization. For the more the Second Wave eliminated diversity in
                              language, leisure, and life-style, the more it needed diversity in the
                              sphere of work. Accelerating the division of labor, the Second Wave
                              replaced the casual jack-of-all-work peasant with the narrow, purse-]]></page><page Index="42"><![CDATA[lipped specialist and the worker who did only one task, Taylor-fashion,
                              over and over again.

                              As early as 1720 a British report on The Advantages of the East India
                              Trade made the point that specialization could get jobs done with "less
                              loss of time and labour." In 1776 Adam Smith opened The Wealth of
                              Nations with the ringing assertion that "the greatest improvement in the
                              productive powers of labour . . . seem[s] to have been the effects of the
                              division of labour."

                              Smith, in a classic passage, described the manufacture of a pin. A
                              single old-style workman, performing all the necessary operations by
                              himself, he wrote, could turn out only a handful of pins each day—no
                              more than twenty and perhaps not oven one. By contrast, Smith
                              described a "manufactory" he Inul visited in which the eighteen
                              different operations required to make a pin were carried out by ten
                              specialized workers, each performing only one or a few steps.
                              Together they were able to produce more than forty-eight thousand
                              pins per day--over forty-eight hundred per worker.

                              By the nineteenth century, as more and more work shifted into the
                              factory, the pin story was repeated again and again on an even-larger
                              scale. And the human costs of specialization escalated accordingly.
                              Critics of industrialism charged that highly specialized repetitive labor
                              progressively dehumanized the worker.

                              By the time Henry Ford started manufacturing Model Ts in 1908 it took
                              not eighteen different operations to complete

                              a unit but 7,882. In his autobiography, Ford noted that of these 7,882
                              specialized jobs, 949 required "strong, able-bodied, and practically
                              physically perfect men," 3,338 needed men of merely "ordinary"
                              physical strength, most of the rest could be performed by "women or
                              older children," and, he continued coolly, "we found that 670 could be
                              filled by legless men, 2,637 by one-legged men, two by armless men,
                              715 by one-armed men and 10 by blind men." In short, the specialized
                              job required not a whole person, but only a part. No more vivid
                              evidence that overspecialization can be brutalizing has ever been
                              adduced.

                              A practice which critics attributed to capitalism, however, became an
                              inbuilt feature of socialism as well. For the extreme specialization of
                              labor that was common to all Second Wave societies had its roots in
                              the divorce of production from consumption. The U.S.S.R., Poland,
                              East Germany, or Hungary can no more run their factories today
                              without elaborate specialization than can Japan or the United States—
                              whose Department of Labor in 1977 published a list of twenty thousand
                              identifiably different occupations.

                              In both capitalist and socialist industrial states, moreover,
                              specialization was accompanied by a rising tide of profession-alization.
                              Whenever the opportunity arose for some group of specialists to]]></page><page Index="43"><![CDATA[monopolize esoteric knowledge and keep newcomers out of their field,
                              professions emerged. As the Second Wave advanced, the market
                              intervened between a knowledge-holder and a client, dividing them
                              sharply into producer and consumer. Thus, health in Second Wave
                              societies came to be seen as a product provided by a doctor and a
                              health-delivery bureaucracy, rather than a result of intelligent self-care
                              (production for use) by the patient. Education was supposedly
                              "produced" by the teacher in the school and "consumed" by the
                              student.

                              All sorts of occupational groups from librarians to salesmen began
                              clamoring for the right to call themselves professionals—and for the
                              power to set standards, prices, and conditions of entry into their
                              specialties. By now, according to Michael Pertschuk, Chairman of the
                              U.S. Federal Trade Commission, "Our culture is dominated by
                              professionals who call us 'clients' and tell us of our 'needs.'"

                              In Second Wave societies even political agitation was conceived of as
                              a profession. Thus Lenin argued that the masses could not bring about
                              a revolution without professional help. What was needed, he asserted,
                              was an "organiza-

                              tion of revolutionaries" limited in membership to "people whose
                              profession is that of a revolutionary."

                              Among communists, capitalists, executives, educators, priests, and
                              politicians, the Second Wave produced a common mentality and a
                              drive toward an ever more refined division of labor. Like Prince Albert
                              at the great Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851, they believed that
                              specialization was "the moving power of civilization." The Great
                              Standardizes and The Great Specializes marched hand in hand.

                              SYNCHRONIZATION

                              The widening split between production and consumption also forced a
                              change in the way Second Wave people dealt with time. In a market-
                              dependent system, whether the market is planned or free, time equals
                              money. Expensive machines cannot be allowed to sit idly, and they
                              operate at rhythms of their own. This produced the third principle of
                              industrial civilization: synchronization.

                              Even in the earliest societies work had to be carefully organized in
                              time. Warriors often had to work in unison to trap their prey. Fishermen
                              had to coordinate then* efforts in rowing or hauling hi the nets. George
                              Thomson, many years ago, showed how various work songs reflected
                              the requirements of labor. For the oarsmen, time was marked by a
                              simple two-syllable sound like O—op! The second syllable indicated
                              the moment of maximum exertion while the first was the time for
                              preparation. Hauling a boat, he noted, was heavier work than rowing,
                              "so the moments of exertion are spaced in longer intervals," and we
                              see, as in the Irish hauling cry Ho-H-ho-hup!, a longer preparation for
                              the final effort.]]></page><page Index="44"><![CDATA[Until the Second Wave brought in machinery and silenced* the songs
                              of the worker, most such synchronization of effort was organic or
                              natural. It flowed from the rhythm of the seasons and from biological
                              processes, from the earth's rotation and the beat of the heart. Second
                              Wave societies, by contrast, moved to the beat of the machine.

                              As factory production spread, the high cost of machinery and the close
                              interdependence of labor required a much more refined
                              synchronization. If one group of workers in a plant was late in
                              completing a task, others down the line would be further delayed. Thus
                              punctuality, never very important in agricultural communities, became
                              a social necessity, and

                              clocks and watches began to proliferate. By the 1790's they were
                              already becoming commonplace hi Britain. Their diffusion came, in the
                              words of British historian E. P. Thompson, "at the exact moment when
                              the industrial revolution demanded a greater synchronization of labor."

                              Not by coincidence, children hi industrial cultures were taught to tell
                              time at an early age. Pupils were conditioned to arrive at school when
                              the bell rang so that later on they would arrive reliably at the factory or
                              office when the whistle blew. Jobs were timed and split into sequences
                              measured hi fractions of a second. "Nine-to-five" formed the temporal
                              frame for millions of workers.

                              Nor was it only working life that was synchronized. In all Second Wave
                              societies, regardless of profit or political considerations, social life, too,
                              became clock-driven and adapted to machine requirements. Certain
                              hours were set aside for leisure. Standard-length vacations, holidays,
                              or coffee breaks were interspersed with the work schedules.

                              Children began and ended the school year at uniform times. Hospitals
                              woke all their patients for breakfast simultaneously. Transport systems
                              staggered under rush hours. Broadcasters fitted entertainment into
                              special time slots— "prime time," for example. Every business had its
                              own peak hours or seasons, synchronized with those of its suppliers
                              and distributors. Specialists in synchronization arose—from factory
                              expediters and schedulers to traffic police and tune-study men.

                              By contrast, some people resisted the new industrial time system. And
                              here again sexual differences arose. Those who participated hi Second
                              Wave work—chiefly men—became the most conditioned to clock-time.

                              Second Wave husbands continually complained that their wives kept
                              them waiting, that they had no regard for time, that it took them forever
                              to dress, that they were always late for appointments. Women,
                              primarily engaged in noninterde-pendent housework, worked to less
                              mechanical rhythms. For similar reasons urban populations tended to
                              look down upon rural folk as slow and unreliable. "They don't show up
                              on time! You never know whether they'll keep an appointment." Such
                              complaints could be traced directly to the difference between Second]]></page><page Index="45"><![CDATA[Wave work based on heightened interdependence and the First Wave

                              BREAKING THE CODE

                              Once the Second Wave became dominant even the most intimate
                              routines of life were locked into the industrial pacing system. In the
                              United States and the Soviet Union, in Singapore and Sweden, in
                              France and Denmark, Germany and Japan, families arose as one, ate
                              at the same time, commuted, worked, returned home, went to bed,
                              slept, and even made love more or less in unison as the entire
                              civilization, in addition to standardization and specialization, applied
                              the principle of synchronization.

                              CONCENTRATION

                              The rise of the market gave birth to yet another rule of Second Wave
                              civilization—the principle of concentration.

                              First Wave societies lived off widely dispersed sources of energy.
                              Second Wave societies became almost totally dependent on highly
                              concentrated deposits of fossil fuel.

                              But the Second Wave concentrated more than energy. It also
                              concentrated population, stripping the countryside of people and
                              relocating them in giant urban centers. It even concentrated work.
                              While work in First Wave societies took place everywhere—in the
                              home, hi the village, in the fields—much of the work in Second Wave
                              societies was done in factories where thousands of laborers were
                              drawn together under a single roof.

                              Nor was it only energy and work that were concentrated. Writing in the
                              British social science journal New Society, Stan Cohen has pointed out
                              that, with minor exceptions, prior to industrialism "the poor were kept at
                              home or with relatives; criminals were fined, whipped or banished from
                              one settlement to another; the insane were kept hi their families, or
                              supported by the community, if they were poor." All thes.e groups
                              were, hi short, dispersed throughout the community.

                              Industrialism revolutionized the situation. The early nineteenth century,
                              in fact, has been called the time of the Great Incarcerations—when
                              criminals were rounded up and concentrated in prisons, the mentally ill
                              rounded up and concentrated in "lunatic asylums," and children
                              rounded up and concentrated in schools, exactly as workers were
                              concentrated in factories.

                              Concentration occurred also in capital flows, so that Second Wave
                              civilization gave birth to the giant corporation and, beyond that, the
                              trust or monopoly. By the mid-1960s, the

                              Similarly, in the United States 80 percent or more of aluminum, beer,
                              cigarettes, and breakfast foods were produced by four or five
                              companies in each field. In Germany 92 percent of all the plasterboard
                              and dyes, 98 percent of photo film, 91 percent of industrial sewing
                              machines, were produced by four or fewer companies in each
                              respective category. The list of highly concentrated industries goes on
                              and on.

                              Socialist managers were also convinced that concentration of
                              production was "efficient." Indeed, many Marxist ideologues in the
                              capitalist countries welcomed the growing concentration of industry in
                              capitalist countries as a necessary step along the way to the ultimate
                              total concentration of industry under state auspices. Lenin spoke of the
                              "conversion of all citizens into workers and employees of one huge
                              'syndicate'—the whole state." Half a century later the Soviet economist
                              N. Lelyukhina, writing in Voprosy Ekonomiki could report that "the
                              USSR possesses the most concentrated industry in the world."

                              Whether in energy, population, work, education, or economic
                              organization, the concentrative principle of Second Wave civilization
                              ran deep—deeper, indeed, than any ideological differences between
                              Moscow and the West.

                              MAXIMIZATION

                              The split-up of production and consumption also created, in all Second
                              Wave societies, a case of obsessive "macro-philia"—a kind of Texan
                              infatuation with bigness and growth. If it were true that long production
                              runs in the factory would produce lower unit costs, then, by analogy,
                              increases in scale would produce economies in other activities as well.
                              "Big" became synonymous with "efficient," and maximization became
                              the fifth key principle.

                              largest dam, or the world's biggest miniature golf

                              course. Since bigness, moreover, was the result of growth, most
                              industrial governments, corporations, and other organizations pursued
                              the ideal of growth frenetically.

                              In 1960, as the United States completed the stage of traditional
                              industrialism and began to feel the first effects of the Third Wave of
                              change, its fifty largest industrial corporations had grown to employ an
                              average of 80,000 workers each. General Motors alone employed
                              595,000, and one utility, Vail's AT&T, employed 736,000 women and
                              men. This meant, at an average household size of 3.3 that year, that
                              well over 2,000,000 people were dependent upon paychecks from this
                              one company alone—a group equal to one half the population of the
                              entire country when Hamilton and Washington were stitching it into a
                              nation. (Since then AT&T has swollen to even more gargantuan
                              proportions. By 1970 it employed 956,000—having added 136,000
                              employees to its work force in a single twelve-month period.)

                              AT&T was a special case and, of course, Americans were peculiarly
                              addicted to bigness. But macrophilia was no monopoly of ib.e
                              Americans. In France in 1963 fourteen hundred firms—a mere V* of 1
                              percent of all companies—employed fully 38 percent of the work force.
                              Governments in Germany, Britain, and other countries actively
                              encouraged mergers to create even larger companies, in the belief that
                              larger scale would help them compete against the American giants.

                              Nor was this scale maximization simply a reflection of profit
                              maximization. Marx had associated the "increasing scale of industrial
                              establishments" with the "wider development of their material powers.'*
                              Lenin, in turn, argued that "huge enterprises, trusts and syndicates had
                              brought the mass production technique to its highest level of
                              development." His first order of business after the Soviet revolution

                              largest possible units. Stalin pushed even harder for maximum scale
                              and built vast new projects—the steel complex at Magnitogorsk,
                              another at Zaporozhstal, the Balkhash copper smelting plant, the

                              larger one.

                              In The Cult of Bigness in Soviet Economic Planning, Dr. Leon M.
                              Herman writes: "In various parts of the USSR, hi fact, local politicians
                              became involved in a race for attracting the *world's largest projects.'"
                              By 1938 the Communist party warned against "gigantomania," but with

                              aggregation of many different kinds of data into the statistical tool
                              known as Gross National Product, which measured the "scale'* of an
                              economy by totting up the value of goods and services produced in it
                              This tool of the Second Wave economists had many failings. From the
                              point of view of GNP it didn't matter whether the output was in the form
                              of food, education and health services, or munitions. The hiring of a
                              crew to build a home or to demolish one both added to GNP, even
                              though one activity added to the stock of housing and the other
                              subtracted from it GNP also, because it measured only market activity
                              or exchanges, relegated to insignificance a whole vital sector of the
                              economy based on unpaid production—child-rearing and housework,
                              for example.

                              Despite these shortcomings, Second Wave governments around the
                              world entered into a blind race to increase GNP at all costs,
                              maximizing "growth" even at the risk of ecological and social disaster.
                              The macrophiliac principle was built so deeply into the industrial
                              mentality that nothing seemed more reasonable. Maximization went
                              along with standardization, specialization, and the other industrial
                              ground rules.

                              CENTRALIZATION

                              Finally, all industrial nations developed centralization into a fine art.

                              knew perfectly well how to centralize power, they dealt with far less
                              complex societies and were crude amateurs by contrast with the men
                              and women who centralized industrial societies from the ground floor
                              up.

                              All complicated societies require a mixture of both centralized and
                              decentralized operations. But the shift from a basically decentralized
                              First Wave economy, with each locality largely responsible for
                              producing its own necessities, to the integrated national economies of
                              the Second Wave led to totally new methods for centralizing power.
                              These came into play at the level of individual companies, industries,
                              and the economy as a whole.

                              The early railroads provide a classic illustration. Compared with other
                              businesses they were the giants of their day. In the United States in
                              1850 only forty-one factories had a capitalization of 250 thousand
                              dollars or more. By contrast, the New York Central Railroad as early as
                              1860 boasted a capitalization of 30 million dollars. To run such a
                              gargantuan enterprise, new management methods were needed.

                              The early railroad managers, therefore, like the managers of titte space
                              program in our own era, had to invent new techniques. They
                              standardized technologies, fares, and schedules. They synchronized
                              operations over hundreds of miles. They created specialized new
                              occupations and departments. They concentrated capital, energy, and]]></page><page Index="49"><![CDATA[people. They fought to maximize the scale of then* networks. And to
                              accomplish all this they created new forms of organization based on
                              centralization of information and command.

                              Employees were divided into "line" and "staff." Daily reports were
                              initiated to provide data on car movements, loadings, damages, lost
                              freight, repairs, engine miles, et cetera. All this information flowed up a
                              centralized chain of command until it reached the general
                              superintendent who made the decisions and sent orders down the line.

                              The railroads, as business historian Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., has
                              shown, soon became a model for other large organizations, and
                              centralized management came to be regarded as an advanced,
                              sophisticated tool in all the Second Wave nations.

                              In politics, too, the Second Wave encouraged centralization. In the
                              United States, as early as the late 1780's, this was illustrated by the
                              battle to replace the loose, decentralist Articles of Confederation with a
                              more centralist Constitution. Generally the First Wave rural interests
                              resisted the concentration of power in the national government, while
                              Second


                              58 THE THIRD WAVE

                              Wave commercial interests led by Hamilton argued, in The Federalist
                              and elsewhere, that a strong central government was essential not
                              only for military and foreign policy reasons but for economic growth.

                              The resultant Constitution of 1787 was an ingenious compromise.
                              Because First Wave forces were still strong, the Constitution reserved
                              important powers to the states rather than the central government. To
                              prevent overly strong central power it also called for a unique
                              separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers. But the
                              Constitution also contained elastic language that would eventually
                              permit the federal government to extend its reach drastically.

                              As industrialization pushed the political system toward greater
                              centralization, the government in Washington took on an increasing
                              number of powers and responsibilities and monopolized more and
                              more decision-making at the center. Within the federal government,
                              meanwhile, power shifted from Congress and the courts to the most
                              centralist of three branches—the Executive. By the Nixon years,
                              historian Arthur Schlesinger (himself once an ardent centralizer) was
                              attacking the "imperial presidency."

                              The pressures toward political centralization were even stronger
                              outside the United States. A quick look at Sweden, Japan, Britain, or
                              France is enough to make the U.S. system seem decentralized by
                              comparison. Jean-Franc.ois Revel, au* thor of Without Marx or Jesus,
                              makes this point in describing how governments respond to political
                              protest: "When a demonstration is forbidden in France, there is never
                              any doubt about the source of the prohibition. If it is a question of a
                              major political demonstration, it is the [central] government," he says.
                              "In the United States, however, when a demonstration is forbidden, the]]></page><page Index="50"><![CDATA[first question everyone asks is, 'By whom?'" Revel points out that it is
                              usually some local authority operating autonomously.

                              The extremes of political centralization were found, of course, in the
                              Marxist industrial nations. In 1850 Marx called for a "decisive
                              centralization of power in the hands of the state." Engels, like Hamilton
                              before him, attacked decentralized confederations as "an enormous
                              step backward." Later on the Soviets, eager to accelerate
                              industrialization, proceeded to construct the most highly centralized
                              political and economic structure of all, submitting even the smallest of
                              production decisions to the control of central planners.

                              BREAKING THE CODE

                              The gradual centralization of a once decentralized economy was
                              aided, moreover, by a crucial invention whose very name reveals its
                              purpose: the central bank.

                              In 1694, at the very dawn of the industrial age, while Newcomen was
                              still tinkering with the steam engine, William Paterson organized the
                              Bank of England—which became a template for similar centralist
                              institutions hi all Second Wave countries. No country could complete
                              its Second Wave phase without constructing its own equivalent of this
                              machine for the central control of money and credit.

                              Paterson's bank sold government bonds; it issued government-backed
                              currency; it later began to regulate the lending practices of other
                              banks. Eventually it took on the primary function of all central banks
                              today: central control of the money supply. In 1800 the Banque de
                              France was formed for similar purposes. This was followed by the
                              formation of the Reichsbank in 1875.

                              In the United States the collision between First and Second Wave
                              forces led to a major battle over central banking shortly after the
                              adoption of the constitution. Hamilton, the most brilliant advocate of
                              Second Wave policies, argued for a national bank on the English
                              model. The South and the frontier West, still wedded to agriculture,
                              opposed him. Nevertheless, with the support of the industrializing
                              Northeast, he succeeded hi forcing through legislation that created the
                              Bank of the United States—forerunner of today's Federal Reserve
                              System.

                              Employed by governments to regulate the level and rate of market
                              activity, central banks introduced—by the back door, as it were—a
                              degree of unofficial short-range planning into capitalist economies.
                              Money flowed through every artery in Second Wave societies, both
                              capitalist and socialist. Both needed, and therefore created, a
                              centralized money pumping station. Central banking and centralized
                              government marched hand in hand. Centralization was another
                              dominating principle of Second Wave civilization.

                              What we see, therefore, is a set of six guiding principles, a "program"
                              that operated to one de*"^ or another in all the Second Wave
                              countries. These half-dozen principles—standardization, specialization,
                              synchronization, concentration, maximization, and centralization—were
                              applied in both the capitalist and socialist wings of industrial society]]></page><page Index="51"><![CDATA[because Hiry grew, inescapably, out of the basic cleavage between

                              ducer and consumer and the ever-expanding role of the market.

                              These principles hi turn, each reinforcing the other, led relentlessly to
                              the rise of bureaucracy. They produced some of the biggest, most
                              rigid, most powerful bureaucratic organizations the world had ever
                              seen, leaving the individual to wander in a Kafka-like world of looming
                              mega-organizations. If today we feel oppressed and overpowered by
                              them, we can trace our problems to the hidden code that programmed
                              the civilization of the Second Wave.

                              The six principles that formed this code lent a distinctive stamp to
                              Second Wave civilization. Today, as we shall shortly see, every one of
                              these fundamental principles is under attack by the forces of the Third
                              Wave.

                              So, indeed, are the Second Wave elites who are still applying these
                              rules—in business, in banking, in labor relations, in government, in
                              education, in the media. For the rise of a new civilization challenges all
                              the vested interests of the old one.

                              In the upheavals that lie immediately ahead, the elites of all industrial
                              societies—so accustomed to setting the rules— will in all likelihood go
                              the way of the feudal lords of the past. Some will be by-passed. Some
                              will be dethroned. Some will be reduced to impotence or shabby
                              gentility. Some—the most intelligent and adaptive—will be transformed
                              and emerge as leaders of the Third Wave civilization.

                              To understand who will run things tomorrow when the Third Wave
                              becomes dominant, we must first know exactly who runs things today.

                              THE TECHNICIANS OF POWER

                              The question "Who runs things?" is a typically Second Wave question.
                              For until the industrial revolution there was little reason to ask it.
                              Whether ruled by kings or shamans, warlords, sun gods, or saints,
                              people were seldom in doubt as to who held power over them. The
                              ragged peasant, looking up from the fields, saw the palace or
                              monastery looming hi splendor on the horizon. He needed no political
                              scientist or newspaper pundit to solve the riddle of power. Everyone
                              knew who was in charge.

                              Wherever the Second Wave swept in, however, a new kind of power
                              emerged, diffuse and faceless. Those in power became the
                              anonymous "they." Who were "they"?

                              THE INTEGRATORS

                              Industrialism, as we have seen, broke society into thousands of
                              interlocking parts—factories, churches, schools, trade unions, prisons,]]></page><page Index="52"><![CDATA[hospitals, and the like. It broke the line of command between church,
                              state, and individual. It broke knowledge into specialized disciplines. It
                              broke jobs into fragments. It broke families into smaller units. In doing
                              so, it shattered community life and culture.

                              Somebody had to put things back together in a different form.

                              This need gave rise to many new kinds of specialists whose basic task
                              was integration. Calling themselves executives or

                              62

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              administrators, commissars, coordinators, presidents, vice* presidents,
                              bureaucrats, or managers, they cropped up in every business, in every
                              government, and at every level of society. And they proved
                              indispensable. They were the integrators.

                              They defined roles and allocated jobs. They decided who got what
                              rewards. They made plans, set criteria, and gave or withheld
                              credentials. They linked production, distribution, transport, and
                              communications. They set the rules under which organizations
                              interacted. In short, they fitted the pieces of the society together.
                              Without them the Second Wave system could never have run.

                              Marx, in the mid-nineteenth century, thought that whoever owned the
                              tools and technology—the "means of production"—would control
                              society. He argued that, because work was interdependent, workers
                              could disrupt production and seize the tools from their boses. Once
                              they owned the tools, they would rule society.

                              Yet history played a trick on him. For the very same inter-dependency
                              gave even greater leverage to a new group— those who orchestrated
                              or integrated the system. In the end it-was neither the owners nor the
                              workers who came to power. In both capitalist and socialist nations, it
                              was the integrators who rose to the top.

                              It was not ownership of the "means of production" that gave power. It
                              was control of the "means of integration.** Let's see what that has
                              meant.

                              In business the earliest integrators were the factory proprietors, the
                              business entrepreneurs, the mill owners and ironmasters. The owner
                              and a few aides were usually able to coordinate the labor of a large
                              number of unskilled "hands" and to integrate the firm into the larger
                              economy.

                              Since, in that period, owner and integrator were one and the same, it is
                              not surprising that Marx confused the two and laid so heavy an
                              emphasis on ownership. As production grew more complex, however,
                              and the division of labor more specialized, business witnessed an
                              incredible proliferation of executives and experts who, came between
                              the boss and his workers. Paperwork mushroomed. Soon in the larger
                              firms no individual, including the owner or dominant shareholder, could

                              new executive elite arose whose power rested no longer on ownership
                              but rather on control of the integration process.

                              As the manager grew in power, the stockholder grew less important.
                              As companies grew bigger, family owners sold out to larger and larger
                              groups of dispersed shareholders, few of whom knew anything about
                              the actual operations of the business. Increasingly, shareholders had
                              to rely on hired managers not merely to run the day-to-day affairs of
                              the company but even to set its long-range goals and strategies.
                              Boards of directors, theoretically representing the owners, were
                              themselves increasingly remote and ill-informed about the operations
                              they were supposed to direct. And as more and more private
                              investment was made not by individuals but indirectly through
                              institutions like pension funds, mutual funds, and the trust departments
                              of banks, the actual "owners" of industry were still further removed
                              from control.

                              The new power of the integrators was, perhaps, most clearly
                              expressed by W. Michael Blumenthal, former U.S. Secretary of the
                              Treasury. Before entering government Blumenthal headed the Bendix
                              Corporation. Once asked if he would some day like to own Bendix,
                              Blumenthal replied: "It's not ownership that counts—it's control. And as
                              Chief Executive that's what I've got! We have a shareholders' meeting
                              next week, and I've got ninety-seven percent of the vote. I only own
                              eight thousand shares. Control is what's important to me. ... To have
                              the control over this large animal and to use it in a constructive way,
                              that's what I want, rather than doing silly things that others want me to
                              do."

                              Business policies were thus increasingly fixed by the hired managers
                              of the firm or by money managers placing other people's money, but in
                              neither case by the actual owners, let alone by the workers. The
                              integrators took charge.

                              All this had certain parallels in the socialist nations. As early as 1921
                              Lenin felt called upon to denounce his own Soviet bureaucracy.
                              Trotsky, in exile by 1930, charged that there were already five to six
                              million managers in a class that "does not engage directly in productive
                              labor, but administers, orders, commands, pardons and punishes." The
                              means of production might belong to the state, he charged, "But the
                              state . . . 'belongs* to the bureaucracy." In the 1950's Mi-lovan Djilas, in
                              The New Class, attacked the growing power of the managerial elites in
                              Yugoslavia. Tito, who imprisoned Djilas, himself complained about
                              "technocracy, bureaucracy,

                              Mao's China.*

                              Under socialism as well as capitalism, therefore, the integrators took
                              effective power. For without them the parts of the system could not
                              work together. The "machine" would not run.

                              THE INTEGRATIONS ENGINE

                              Integrating a single business, or even a whole industry, was only a
                              small part of what had to be done. Modern industrial society, as we
                              have seen, developed a host of organizations, from labor unions and
                              trade associations to churches, schools, health clinics, and recreational
                              groups, all of which had to work within a framework of predictable
                              rules. Laws were needed. Above all, the info-sphere, socio-sphere,
                              and techno-sphere had to be brought into alignment with one another.

                              Out of this driving need for the integration of Second Wave civilization
                              came the biggest coordinator of all—the in-tegrational engine of the
                              system: big government. It is the system's hunger for integration that
                              explains the relentless rise of big government in every Second Wave
                              society.

                              Again and again political demagogues arose to call for smaller
                              government. Yet, once in office, the very same leaders expanded
                              rather than contracted the size of government. This contradiction
                              between rhetoric and real life becomes understandable the moment we
                              recognize that the transcendent aim of all Second Wave governments
                              has been to construct and maintain industrial civilization. Against this
                              commitment, all lesser differences faded. Parties and politicians might
                              squabble over other issues, but on this they were in tacit agreement
                              And big government was part of their unspoken program regardless of
                              the tune they sang, because industrial societies depend on
                              government to perform essential inte-grational tasks.

                              In the words of political columnist Clayton Fritchey, the United States
                              federal government never ceased to grow, even under three recent
                              Republican administrations, "for the

                              * Mao, leading the world's biggest First Wave nation, repeatedly
                              warned against the rise of managerial elites and saw this as a
                              dangerous concomitant of traditional industrialism.

                              and harmful consequences."

                              Free marketeers have argued that governments interfere with
                              business. But left to private enterprise alone, industrialization would
                              have come much more slowly—if, indeed, it could have come at all.
                              Governments quickened the development of the railroad. They built
                              harbors, roads, canals, and highways. They operated postal services
                              and built or regulated telegraph, telephone, and broadcast systems.]]></page><page Index="55"><![CDATA[They wrote commercial codes and standardized markets. They applied
                              foreign policy pressures and tariffs to aid industry. They drove farmers
                              off the land and into the industrial labor supply. They subsidized
                              energy and advanced technology, often through military channels. At a
                              thousand levels, governments assumed the integrative tasks that
                              others could not, or would not, perform.

                              For government was the great accelerator. Because of its coercive
                              power and tax revenues, it could do things that private enterprise could
                              not afford to undertake. Governments could "hot up" the
                              industrialization process by stepping in to fill emerging gaps in the
                              system—before it became possible or profitable for private companies
                              to do so. Governments could perform "anticipatory integration.*'

                              By setting up mass education systems, governments not only helped
                              to machine youngsters for their future roles in the industrial work force
                              (hence, in effect, subsidizing industry) but also simultaneously
                              encouraged the spread of the nuclear family form. By relieving the
                              family of educational and other traditional functions, governments
                              accelerated the adaptation of family structure to the needs of the
                              factory system. At many different levels, therefore, governments
                              orchestrated the complexity of Second Wave civilization.

                              Not surprisingly, as integration grew in importance both the substance
                              and style of government changed. Presidents and prime ministers, for
                              example, came to see themselves primarily as managers rather than
                              as creative social and political leaders. In personality and manner they
                              became almost interchangeable with the men who ran the large
                              companies and production enterprises. While offering the obligatory lip
                              service to democracy and social justice, the Nixons, Carters,
                              Thatchers, Brezhnevs, Giscards, and Ohiras of the industrial world
                              rode into office by promising little more than efficient management.

                              THE THIRD WAVE



                              Across the board, therefore, in socialist as well as capitalist industrial
                              societies, the same pattern emerged—big companies or production
                              organizations and a huge governmental machine. And rather than
                              workers seizing the means of production, as Marx predicted, or
                              capitalists retaining power, as Adam Smith's followers might have
                              preferred, a wholly new ^—force arose to challenge both. The
                              technicians of power V seized the "means of integration" and, with it,
                              the reins of so-j cial, cultural, political, and economic control. Second
                              Wave I societies were ruled by the integrators,

                              These technicians of power were themselves organized into
                              hierarchies of elites and sub-elites. Every industry and branch of
                              government soon gave birth to its own establishment, its own powerful
                              "They."]]></page><page Index="56"><![CDATA[Sports . . . religion . . . education . . . each had its own pyramid of
                              power. A science establishment, a defense establishment, a cultural
                              establishment sprang up. Power in Second Wave civilization was
                              parceled out to scores, hundreds, even thousands of such specialized
                              elites.

                              In turn, these specialized elites were themselves integrated by
                              generalist elites whose membership cut across all the specializations.
                              For example, in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe the Communist
                              party had members in every field from aviation to music and steel
                              manufacture. Communist party members served as a crucial grapevine
                              carrying messages from one sub-elite to another. Because it had
                              access to all information, it had enormous power to regulate the
                              specialist sub-elites. In the capitalist countries, leading businessmen
                              and lawyers, serving on civic committees or boards, performed similar
                              functions in a less formal way. What we see, therefore, in all Second
                              Wave nations are specialized groups of integrators, bureaucrats, or
                              executives, themselves integrated by generalist integrators.

                              THE SUPER-ELITES

                              Finally, at yet a higher level, integration was imposed by the "super-
                              elites" in charge of investment allocation. Whether in finance or
                              industry, in the Pentagon or in the Soviet plan-

                              THE TECHNICIANS OF POWER 67

                              ning bureaucracy, those who made the major investment allocations in
                              industrial society set the limits within which the integrators themselves
                              were compelled to function. Once a truly large-scale investment
                              decision had been made, whether in Minneapolis or Moscow, it limited
                              future options. Given a scarcity of resources, one could not casually
                              tear out Bessemer furnaces or cracking plants or assembly lines until
                              their cost had been amortized. Once in place, therefore, this capital
                              stock fixed the parameters within which future managers or integrators
                              were confined. These groups of faceless decision-makers, controlling
                              the levers of investment, formed the super-elite in all industrial
                              societies.

                              In every Second Wave society, consequently, a parallel architecture of
                              elites sprang up. And—with local variation— this hidden hierarchy of
                              power was born again after every crisis or political upheaval. Names,
                              slogans, party labels and candidates might change; revolutions might
                              come and go. New faces might appear behind the big mahogany
                              desks. But the basic architecture of power remained.

                              Time and again during the past three hundred years, in one country
                              after another, rebels and reformers have attempted to storm the walls
                              of power, to build a new society based on social justice and political
                              equality. Temporarily, such movements have seized the emotions of
                              millions with promises of freedom. Revolutionists have even managed,
                              now and then, to topple a regime.

                              Yet each time the ultimate outcome was the same. Each time the
                              rebels re-created, under then* own flag, a similar structure of sub-
                              elites, elites, and super-elites. For this inte-grational structure and the]]></page><page Index="57"><![CDATA[technicians of power who ruled it were as necessary to Second Wave

                              and the full democracy it promised were, in fact, incompatible.

                              Industrial nations could be forced, through revolutionary action or
                              otherwise, to move back and forth across the spectrum from free
                              market to centrally planned. They could go from capitalist to socialist
                              and vice versa. But like the much-cited leopard, they could not change
                              their spots. They could not function without a powerful hierarchy of
                              integrators.

                              Today, as the Third Wave of change begins to batter at this fortress of
                              managerial power, the first fleeting cracks are nppearing in the power
                              system. Demands for participation in in.-magement, for shared
                              decision-making, for worker, con-•umer, and citizen control, and for
                              anticipatory democracy

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              are welling up in nation after nation. New ways of organizing along less
                              hierarchical and more ad-hocratic lines are springing up in the most
                              advanced industries. Pressures for decentralization of power intensify.
                              And managers become more and more dependent upon information
                              from below. Elites themselves, therefore, are becoming less
                              permanent and secure. All these are merely early warnings—indicators
                              of the coming upheaval in the political system.

                              The Third Wave, already beginning to batter at these industrial
                              structures, opens fantastic opportunities for social and political
                              renovation. In the years just ahead startling new institutions will replace
                              our unworkable, oppressive, and obsolete integrational structures.

                              Before we turn to these new possibilities, we need to press our
                              analysis of the dying system. We need to X-ray our obsolete political
                              system to see how it fitted into the frame of Second Wave civilization,
                              how it served the industrial order and its elites. Only then can we
                              understand why it is no longer appropriate or tolerable.

                              THE HIDDEN BLUEPRINT

                              Nothing is more confusing to a Frenchman than the spectacle of an
                              American presidential campaign: the hot-dog gulping, backslapping,
                              and baby kissing, the coy refusal to cast hat in ring, the primaries, the
                              conventions, followed by the manic frenzy of fund raising, whistle-
                              stopping, speechmaking, television commercials—all in the name of
                              democracy. By contrast, Americans find it hard to make sense of the
                              way the French choose their leaders. Still less do they understand the
                              tame British elections, the Dutch free-for-all with two dozen parties, the
                              Australian preferential voting system, or the Japanese wheeling and
                              dealing among factions. All these political systems seem frightfully
                              different from one another. Even more incomprehensible are the one-
                              party elections or pseudo-elections that take place in the U.S.S.R. and
                              Eastern Europe. When it comes to politics, no two industrial nations
                              look the same.]]></page><page Index="58"><![CDATA[Yet once we tear away our provincial blinders we suddenly discover
                              that a set of powerful parallels lies beneath the surface differences. In
                              fact, it is almost as if the political systems of all Second Wave nations
                              were built from the same hidden blueprint.

                              When Second Wave revolutionaries managed to topple First Wave
                              elites in France, in the United States, in Russia, Japan, and other
                              nations, they were faced with the need to write constitutions, set up
                              new governments, and design almost from scratch new political
                              institutions. In the excitement of creation they debated new ideas, new
                              structures. Everywhere they fought over the nature of representation.
                              Who

                              should represent whom? Should representatives be instructed how to
                              vote by the people—or use their own judgment? Should terms of office
                              be long or short? What role should parties play?

                              In each country a new political architecture emerged these conflicts
                              and debates. A close look at these structures reveals that they are built
                              on a combination of old Wave assumptions and newer ideas swept hi
                              by the industrial age.

                              After millennia of agriculture, it was hard for the founders of Second
                              Wave political systems to imagine an economy based on labor, capital,
                              e-ergy, and raw materials, rather than land. Land had always been at
                              the very center of life r self. Not surprisingly, therefore, geography was
                              deeply embedded in our various voting systems. Senators and
                              congressmen in America—and their counterparts in Britain and many
                              other industrial nations—are still elected not as representatives of
                              lontno «r.~-i <-ias<? or o'-pima.tional, ethnic, sexual, or life-style
                              grouping, but as representatives of the inhabitants of a particular piece
                              of land: a geographical district.

                              First Wave people were tvtvcallv immobile, and it was therefore natural
                              for the architects of industrial-era political systems to assume that
                              people would remain in one locality all their lives. Hence the nrwa^nce,
                              even today, of residency requirements hi voting regulations.

                              The pace of First Wave life was slow. Communications were so
                              primitive that it might take a week for a message from the Continental
                              Congress in Philadelphia to reach New York. A speech by Georse
                              Washington took weeks or months to filter through to the hinterland. As
                              late as 1865 it still took twelve days for London to learn that Lincoln
                              had been assassinated. On the unspoken assumption that things
                              moved slowly, representative bodies like Congress or the British
                              Parliament were regarded as "deliberative"—having the tune and
                              taking the time to think through their problems.

                              Most First Wave people were illiterate and ignorant. Thus it was widely
                              assumed that representatives, particularly if drawn from the educated]]></page><page Index="59"><![CDATA[classes, would inevitably make more intelligent decisions than the
                              mass of voters.

                              But even as they built these First Wave assumptions into our political
                              institutions, the revolutionaries of the Second Wave also cast their
                              eyes on the future. Thus the architecture

                              they constructed reflected some of the latest technological notions of
                              their time.

                              MECHANO-MANIA

                              The businessmen, intellectuals, and revolutionaries of the early
                              industrial period were virtually mesmerized by machinery. They were
                              fascinated by steam engines, clocks, looms, pumps, and pistons, and
                              they constructed endless analogies based on the simple mechanistic
                              technologies of their time. It was no accident that men like Benjamin
                              Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were scientists and inventors as well
                              as political revolutionaries.

                              They grew up in the churning cultural wake of Newton's great
                              discoveries. Newton had searched the heavens and concluded that the
                              entire universe was a giant clockwork operating with exact mechanical
                              regularity. La Mettrie, the French physician and philosopher, in 1748
                              declared man himself to be a machine. Adam Smith later extended the
                              analogy of the machine to economics, arguing that the economy is a
                              system and that systems "in many respects resemble machines."

                              James Madison, in describing the debates that led to the United States
                              Constitution, spoke of the need to "remodel" the "system," to change
                              the "structure" of political power, and to choose officials through
                              "successive filtrations." The Constitution itself was filled with "checks
                              and balances" like the inner works of a giant clock. Jefferson spoke of
                              the "machinery of government."

                              American political thinking continued to reverberate with the sound of
                              flywheels, chains, gears, checks and balances. Thus Martin Van Buren
                              invented the "political machine" and eventually New York City had its
                              Tweed machine, Tennessee its Crump machine, New Jersey its Hague
                              machine. Generations of American politicians, right down to the
                              present, prepared political "blueprints," "engineered elections," "steam-
                              rollered" or "railroaded" bills through Congress and the state
                              legislatures. In the nineteenth century in Britain, 'Lord Cromer
                              conceived of an imperial government that would "ensure the
                              harmonious working of the different parts of the machine."

                              Nor was this mechanistic mentality a product of capitalism. Lenin, for
                              example, described that state as "nothing

                              72

                              THE THIRD WAVE]]></page><page Index="60"><![CDATA[more than a machine used by the capitalists to suppress the workers."
                              Trotsky spoke of "all the wheels and screws of the bourgeois social
                              mechanism" and went on to describe the function of a revolutionary
                              party in similarly mechanical phrases. Terming it a powerful
                              "apparatus," he pointed out that "as with any mechanism this is in itself
                              static . . . the movement of the masses has ... to overcome dead
                              inertia. . . . Thus, the living force of steam has to overcome the inertia
                              of the machine before it can set the flywheel in motion."

                              Drenched in such mechanistic thinking, imbued with an almost blind
                              faith in the power and efficiency of machines, the revolutionary
                              founders of Second Wave societies, whether capitalist or socialist, not
                              surprisingly invented political institutions that shared many of the
                              characteristics of early industrial machines.

                              THE REPRESENTO-KIT

                              The structures they hammered and bolted together were based on the
                              elemental notion of representation. And in every country they made
                              use of certain standard parts. These components came out of what
                              might be called, only half facetiously, a universal represento-kit

                              The components were:

                              1. Individuals armed with the vote

                              2. Parties for collecting votes

                              3. Candidates who, by winning votes, were instantly transformed into
                              "representatives" of the voters

                              4. Legislatures (parliaments, diets, congresses, bunde-stags, or
                              assemblies) in which, by voting, representatives manufactured laws

                              5. Executives (presidents, prime ministers, party secretaries) who fed
                              raw material into the lawmaking machine in the form of policies, and
                              then enforced the resulting laws

                              Votes were the "atom" of this Newtonian mechanism. Votes were
                              aggregated by parties, which served as the "manifold" of the system.
                              They gathered votes from many sources and fed them into the
                              electoral adding machine, which blended them in proportion to party
                              strength or mixture, producing as

                              THE HIDDEN BLUEPRINT

                              powered the machinery of government.

                              The parts of this kit were combined and manipulated in different ways
                              in different places. In some places everyone over the age of twenty-
                              one was permitted to vote; elsewhere only white males were
                              enfranchised; in one country the entire process was merely a facade]]></page><page Index="61"><![CDATA[for control by a dictator; in another the elected officials actually wielded
                              considerable power. Here there were two parties, there a multiplicity of
                              parties, elsewhere only one. Nevertheless, the historical pattern is
                              clear. However the parts might be modified or configured, this same
                              basic kit was used in constructing the formal political machinery of all
                              industrial nations.

                              Even though Communists frequently attacked "bourgeois democracy"
                              and '^arliamentarianism" as a mask for privilege, arguing that the
                              mechanisms were usually manipulated by the capitalist class for its
                              own private gain, all socialist industrial nations installed similar
                              representational machines as soon as possible.

                              While holding forth a promise of "direct democracy" in some far-off
                              post-representational era, they relied heavily in the meantime on
                              "socialist representative institutions." The Hungarian Communist Ott6
                              Bihari, in a study of these institutions, writes, "in the course of election
                              the will of the working people makes its influence felt hi the
                              governmental organs called to life by voting." The editor of Pravda, V.
                              G. Afanasyev, in his book The Scientific Management of Society
                              defines "democratic centralism" as including "the sovereign power of
                              the working people ... the election of governing bodies and leaders and
                              their accountability to the people."

                              Just as the factory came to symbolize the entire industrial techno-
                              sphere, representative government (no matter how denatured) became
                              the status symbol of every "advanced" nation. Indeed, even many non-
                              industrial nations—under pressure from colonizers or through blind
                              imitation—rushed to install the same formal mechanisms and used the
                              same universal represento-kit.

                              Nor were these "democracy machines" restricted to the national level.
                              They were installed at state, provincial, and local levels as well, right
                              down to the town or village council. To-

                              day in the United States alone there are some five-hundred thousand
                              elected public officials and 25,869 local governmental units in
                              metropolitan areas, each with its own elections, representative bodies,
                              and election procedures.

                              Thousands of these representational machines are creaking and
                              grinding away hi nonmetropolitan regions, and tens of thousands more
                              around the world. In Swiss cantons and French departments, in the
                              countries of Britain and the provinces of Canada, in the voivodships of
                              Poland and the republics of the Soviet Union, in Singapore and Haifa,
                              Osaka and Oslo, candidates run for office and are magically
                              transmuted into "representatives." It is safe to say that more than one-
                              hundred thousand of these machines are now manufacturing laws,
                              decrees, regulations, and rules in Second Wave countries alone.*

                              In theory, just as each human being and each vote was a discrete,
                              atomic unit, each of these political units—national, provincial, and
                              local—was also regarded as discrete and atomic. Each had its own
                              carefully defined jurisdiction, its own powers, its own rights and duties.]]></page><page Index="62"><![CDATA[The units were wired together in hierarchical arrangement, from top to
                              bottom, from nation to state or region or local authority. But as
                              industrialism matured and the economy grew increasingly integrated,
                              decisions taken by each of these political units touched off effects
                              outside its own jurisdiction, thereby causing other political bodies to act
                              in response.

                              A decision by the Diet regarding the Japanese textile industry could
                              influence employment in North Carolina and welfare services in
                              Chicago. A congressional vote to put quotas on foreign automobiles
                              could make additional work for local governments in Nagoya or Turin.
                              Thus while at one time politicians could make a decision without
                              upsetting conditions outside their own neatly defined jurisdiction, this
                              became less and less possible.

                              By the mid-twentieth century, tens of thousands of ostensi-

                              * Apart from governments as such, virtually all the political parties of
                              industrialism, from extreme right to extreme left, routinely went through
                              the traditional motions of choosing their own leaders by vote. Even
                              contests for precinct-level or local cell leadership typically required
                              some form of election, if only for the ratification of choices made from
                              above. And in many countries the ritual of election became a standard
                              part of the life of all sorts of other organizations, from trade unions and
                              churches to Cub Scout packs. Voting became part of the industrial way
                              of life.

                              THE HIDDEN BLUEPRINT

                              75

                              bly sovereign or independent political authorities, stretching around the
                              planet, were connected to one another through the circuits of the
                              economy, through vastly increased travel, migration, and
                              communication, so that they continually activated and excited one
                              another.

                              The thousands of representational mechanisms built out of
                              components of the represento-kit thus increasingly came to form a
                              single invisible supermachine: a global law factory. Now it remains only
                              for us to see how the levers and control wheels of this global system
                              were manipulated—and by whom.

                              THE REASSURANCE RITUAL

                              Born of the liberating dreams of Second Wave revolutionaries,
                              representative government was a stunning advance over earlier power
                              systems, a technological triumph more striking in its own way than the
                              steam engine or the airplane.

                              Representative government made possible orderly succession without
                              hereditary dynasty. It opened feedback channels between top and
                              bottom in society. It provided an arena in which the differences among
                              various groups could be reconciled peacefully.]]></page><page Index="63"><![CDATA[Tied to majority rule and the idea of one-man/one-vote, it helped the
                              poor and weak to squeeze benefits from the technicians of power who
                              ran the integrational engines of society. For these reasons, the spread
                              of representative government was, on the whole, a humanizing
                              breakthrough in history.

                              Yet from the very beginning it fell far short of its promise. By no stretch
                              of the imagination was it ever controlled by the people, however
                              defined. Nowhere did it actually change the underlying structure of
                              power in industrial nations—the structure of sub-elites, elites, and
                              super-elites. Indeed, far from weakening control by the managerial
                              elites, the formal machinery of representation became one of the key
                              means of integration by which they maintained themselves in power.

                              Thus elections, quite apart from who won them, performed a powerful
                              cultural function for the elites. To the degree that -everyone had a right
                              to vote, elections fostered the illusion of equality. Voting provided a
                              mass ritual of reassurance, conveying to the people the idea that
                              choices were being made systematically, with machine-like regularity,
                              and hence, by, implication, rationally. Elections symbolically assured

                              that they were still in command—that they could, in theory at least, dis-
                              elect as well as elect leaders. In both capitalist and socialist countries,
                              these ritual reassurances often proved more important than the actual
                              outcomes of many elections.

                              Integrational elites programmed the political machinery differently in
                              each place, controlling the number of parties or manipulating voting
                              eligibility. Yet the electoral ritual—some might say farce—was
                              employed everywhere. The fact that Soviet and Eastern European
                              elections routinely produced magical majorities of 99 to 100 percent
                              suggested that the need for reassurance remained at least as strong in
                              the centrally planned societies as in the "free world." Elections took the
                              steam out of protests from below.

                              Furthermore, despite the efforts of democratic reformers and radicals,
                              the integrational elites retained virtually permanent control of the
                              systems of representative government. Many theories have been
                              advanced to explain why. Most, however, overlook the mechanical
                              nature of the system.

                              If we look at Second Wave political systems with the eyes of an
                              engineer rather than a political scientist, we suddenly are struck by a
                              key fact that generally goes unobserved.

                              Industrial engineers routinely distinguish between two fundamentally
                              different classes of machine: those that function intermittently,
                              otherwise known as "batch-processing" machines, and those that
                              function uninterruptedly, called "continuous-flow" machines. An]]></page><page Index="64"><![CDATA[example of the first is the commonplace punch press. The worker
                              brings a batch of metal plates and feeds them into the machine, one or
                              a few at a time, to stamp them into desired shapes. When the batch is
                              finished the machine stops until a new batch is brought. An example of
                              the second is the oil refinery which, once started up, never stops
                              running. Twenty-four hours a day, oil flows through its pipes and tubes
                              and chambers.

                              If we look at the global law factory, with its intermittent voting, we find
                              ourselves face to face with a classical batch processor. The public is
                              allowed to choose between candidates at stipulated times, after which
                              the formal "democracy machine" is switched off again.

                              Contrast this with the continuous flow of influence from various
                              organized interests, pressure groups, and power peddlers. Swarms of
                              lobbyists from corporations and from government agencies,
                              departments, and ministries testify before committees, serve on blue-
                              ribbon panels, attend the same receptions and banquets, toast each

                              and forth, and thus affect the decision-making process on a round-the-
                              clock basis.

                              The elites, in short, created a powerful continuous-flow machine to
                              operate alongside (and often at cross purposes with) the democratic
                              batch processor. Only when we see these two machines side by side
                              can we begin to understand how state power was really exercised in
                              the global law factory.

                              So long as they played the representational game, people had at best
                              only intermittent opportunities, through voting, to feed back their
                              approval or disapproval of the government and its actions. The
                              technicians of power, by contrast, influenced those actions
                              continuously.

                              Finally, an even more potent tool for social control was engineered into
                              the very principle of representation. For the mere selection of some
                              people to represent others created new members of the elite.

                              When workers, for example, first fought for the right to organize unions,
                              they were harassed, prosecuted for conspiracy, followed by company
                              spies, or beaten up by police and goon squads. They were outsiders,
                              unrepresented or inadequately represented in the system.

                              Once unions established themselves, they gave rise to a new group of
                              integrators—the labor establishment—whose members, rather than
                              simply representing the workers, mediated between them and the
                              elites in business and government. The George Meanys and Georges
                              Seguys of the world, despite then* rhetoric, became themselves key
                              members of the integrational elite. The fake union leaders in the]]></page><page Index="65"><![CDATA[U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe never were anything but technicians of
                              power.

                              In theory, the need to stand for re-election guaranteed that
                              representatives would stay honest and would continue to speak for
                              those they represented. Nowhere, however, did this prevent the
                              absorption of representatives into the architecture of power.
                              Everywhere the gap widened between the representative and the
                              represented.

                              Representative government—what we have been taught to call
                              democracy—was, in short, an industrial technology for assuring
                              inequality. Representative government was pseudore-presentative.

                              What we see, then, glancing backward for a moment of summary, is a
                              civilization heavily dependent on fossil fuels,

                              and the mass media, all based on a widening cleavage between
                              production and consumption—and all managed by a set of elites
                              whose task it was to integrate the whole.

                              In this system, representative government was the political equivalent
                              of the factory. Indeed, it was a factory for the manufacture of collective
                              integrational decisions. Like most factories, it was managed from
                              above. And like most factories, it is now increasingly obsolete, a victim
                              of the advancing Third Wave.

                              If Second Wave political structures are increasingly out of date, unable
                              to cope with today's complexities—part of the trouble, as we shall see,

                              Abaco is an island. It has a population of sixty-five hundred and forms
                              part of the Bahamas lying off the coast of Florida. Several years ago a
                              group of American businessmen, arms merchants, free enterprise
                              ideologues, a Black intelligence agent, and a member of the British

                              Alas for free enterprise, the native Abaconians showed little inclination
                              to throw off their chains, and the proposed new nation was stillborn.

                              Nevertheless, in a world in which nationalist movements battle for
                              power, and in which some 152 states claim membership in that trade
                              association of nations, the U.N., such parodic gestures serve a useful
                              purpose. They force us to challenge the Very notion of nationhood.

                              Could the sixty-five hundred people of Abaco, whether financed by
                              oddball businessmen or not, constitute a nation? If Singapore with its
                              2.3 million people is a nation, why not New York City with its 8 million?

                              at the very foundations of Second Wave civilization. For one of those
                              foundations was, and is, the nation-state.

                              Until we cut through the foggy rhetoric that surrounds the issue of
                              nationalism, we cannot make sense of the headlines and we cannot
                              understand the conflict between First and Second Wave civilizations as
                              the Third Wave strikes them both.

                              CHANGING HORSES

                              Before the Second Wave began rolling across Europe most regions of
                              the world were not yet consolidated into nations but were organized,
                              rather, into a mishmash of tribes, clans, duchies, principalities,
                              kingdoms, and other more or less local units. "Kings and princes," write
                              the political scientist S. E. Finer, "held powers hi bits and blobs."
                              Borders were ill-defined, governmental rights fuzzy. The power of the
                              state was not yet standardized. In one village, Professor Finer tells us,
                              it amounted only to the right to collect tolls on a windmill, in another to
                              tax the peasants, elsewhere to appoint an abbot. An individual with
                              property in several different regions might owe allegiance to several
                              lords. Even the greatest of emperors typically ruled over a patchwork
                              of tiny locally-governed communities. Political control was not yet
                              uniform. Voltaire summed it all up: In traveling across Europe, he
                              complained, he had to change laws as frequently as horses.

                              There was more to this quip than met the eye, of course, for the
                              frequent need to change horses reflected the primitive level of
                              transport and communications—which, hi turn, reduced the distance
                              over which even the most powerful monarch could impose effective
                              control. The farther from the capital, the weaker the authority of the
                              state.]]></page><page Index="67"><![CDATA[Yet without political integration, economic integration was impossible.
                              Costly new Second Wave technologies could only be amortized if they
                              produced goods for larger-than-local markets. But how could
                              businessmen buy and sell over a large territory if, outside their own
                              communities, they ran into a maze of different duties, taxes, labor
                              regulations, and currencies? For the new technologies to pay off, local
                              economies had to be consolidated into a single national economy. This
                              meant a national division of labor and a national market for
                              commodities and capital. All this, in turn, required national political
                              consolidation as well.

                              A FRENZY OF NATIONS

                              81

                              Put simply, a Second Wave political unit was needed to match the
                              growth of Second Wave economic units.

                              Not surprisingly, as Second Wave societies began to build national
                              economies, a basic shift in public consciousness became evident. The
                              small-scale local production in First Wave societies had bred a race of
                              highly provincial people—most of whom concerned themselves
                              exclusively with then: own neighborhoods or villages. Only a tiny
                              handful—a few nobles and churchmen, a scattering of merchants and
                              a social fringe of artists, scholars, and mercenaries—had interests
                              beyond the village.

                              The Second Wave swiftly multiplied the number of people with a stake
                              in the larger world. With steam- and coal-based technologies, and later
                              with the advent of electricity, it became possible for a manufacturer of
                              clothing in Frankfurt, watches in Geneva, or textiles in Manchester to
                              produce far more units than the local market could absorb. He also
                              needed raw materials from afar. The factory worker, too, was affected
                              by financial events occurring thousands of miles away: jobs depended
                              on distant markets.

                              Bit by bit, therefore, psychological horizons expanded. The new mass
                              media increased the amount of information and imagery from far away.
                              Under the impact of these changes, localism faded. National
                              consciousness stirred.

                              Starting with the American and French revolutions and continuing
                              through the nineteenth century, a frenzy of nationalism swept across
                              the industrializing parts of the world. Germany's three hundred and fifty
                              petty, diverse, quarreling mini-states needed to be combined into a
                              single national market—das Vaterland. Italy—broken into pieces and
                              ruled variously by the House of Savoy, the Vatican, the Austrian
                              Hapsburgs, and the Spanish Bourbons—had to be united. Hungarians,
                              Serbs, Croats, Frenchmen, and others all suddenly developed mystical
                              affinities for then* fellows. Poets exalted the national spirit. Historians
                              discovered long-lost heroes, literature, and folklore. Composers wrote
                              hymns to nationhood. All at precisely the moment when
                              industrialization made it necessary.

                              Once we understand the industrial need for integration, the meaning of
                              the national state becomes clear. Nations are not "spiritual unities" as]]></page><page Index="68"><![CDATA[Spengler termed them, or '*mental communities" or "social souls." Nor

                              "shared image of the future," as Ortega insisted.

                              82 THE THIRD WAVE

                              What we call the modern nation is a Second Wave phenomenon: a
                              single integrated political authority superimposed on or fused with a
                              single integrated economy. A ragbag collection of locally self-sufficient,
                              sparsely connected economies cannot, and does not, give rise to a
                              nation. Nor is a tightly unified political system a modern nation if it sits
                              atop a loose conglomeration of local economies. It was the welding of
                              the two, a unified political system and a unified economy, that made
                              the modern nation.

                              Nationalist uprisings triggered by the industrial revolution in the United
                              States, in France, in Germany and the rest of Europe, can be seen as
                              efforts to bring the level of political integration up to the fast-rising level
                              of economic integration that accompanied the Second Wave. And it
                              was these efforts, not poetry or mystical influences, that led to the
                              division of the world into distinct national units.

                              THE GOLDEN SPIKE

                              As each government sought to extend its market and its political
                              authority, it came up against outer limits—language differences,
                              cultural, social, geographic, and strategic barriers. The available
                              transport, communication, and energy supplies, the productivity of its
                              technology, all set limits on how large an area could be effectively
                              ruled by a single political structure. The sophistication of accounting
                              procedures, budgetary controls, and management techniques also
                              determined how far political integration could reach.

                              Within these limits, the integrational elites, corporate and governmental
                              alike, fought for expansion. The broader the territory under their control
                              and the bigger the economic market area, the greater their wealth and
                              power became. As each nation stretched its economic and political
                              frontiers to the utmost, it ran up not merely against these inherent limits
                              but also against rival nations.

                              To break out of these confines the integrational elites used advanced
                              technology. They hurled themselves, for example, into the "space
                              race" of the nineteenth century—the building of railroads.

                              In September 1825 a rail line was established that linked Stockton to
                              Darlington in Britain. In May 1835, on the continent, Brussels was tied
                              to Malines. That September in Bavaria the Nuremberg-Furth line was
                              laid. Next were Paris

                              and St. Germain. Far to the east, in April 1838, Tsarkoe Selo was
                              connected to St. Petersburg. For the next three decades or more,
                              railroad workers stitched one region to another.]]></page><page Index="69"><![CDATA[The French historian Charles Moraze" explains: "The countries which
                              were already almost united in 1830 were consolidated by the coming of
                              the railway . . . those still unprepared saw new bands of steel . . .
                              tightening around them. ... It was as if every possible nation was
                              hastening to proclaim its right to exist before the railways were built, so
                              that it might be acknowledged as a nation by the transport system
                              which defined the political boundaries of Europe for over a century."

                              In the United States the government awarded vast land grants to the
                              private railroad companies, inspired, as historian Brace Mazlish has
                              written, by "the conviction that transcontinental roads would strengthen
                              the ties of union between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts." Hammering
                              hi the golden spike that completed the first transcontinental rail line
                              opened the door to a truly national market—integrated on a continental
                              scale. And it extended the actual, as distinct from nominal, control of
                              the national government. Washington could now move troops quickly
                              all across the continent to enforce its authority.

                              What one saw, therefore, hi one country after another, was the rise of
                              this powerful new entity—the nation. In this way the world map came to
                              be divided into a set of neat, nonov-crlapping patches of red, pink,
                              orange, yellow, or green, and the nation-state system became one of
                              the key structures of Second Wave civilization.

                              Beneath the nation lay the familiar imperative of industri-.alism: the
                              drive toward integration.

                              But the drive for integration did not end at the borders of each nation-
                              state. For all its strengths, industrial civilization had to be fed from
                              without. It could not survive unless it integrated the rest of the world
                              into the money system and controlled that system for its own benefit.

                              How it did so is crucial to any understanding of the world the Third
                              Wave will create.

                              THE IMPERIAL DRIVE

                              No civilization spreads without conflict. Second Wave civilization soon
                              launched a massive attack on the First Wave world, triumphed, and
                              imposed its will on millions, ultimately billions, of human beings.

                              Long before the Second Wave, of course, from the sixteenth century
                              on, European rulers had already begun to build extensive colonial
                              empires. Spanish priests and conquistadors, French trappers, British,
                              Dutch, and Portuguese or Italian adventurers fanned out across the
                              globe, enslaving or decimating whole populations, claiming control of
                              vast lands, and sending tribute home to then- monarchs.

                              Compared with what was to follow, however, all this was insignificant.

                              For the treasure these early adventurers and conquerors sent home
                              was, in effect, private booty. It financed wars and personal opulence—
                              whiter palaces, colorful pageantry, a leisurely workless life-style for the
                              court. But it had little to do with the still basically self-sufficient
                              economy of the colonizing country.]]></page><page Index="70"><![CDATA[Largely outside the money system and the market economy, the serfs

                              materials stolen or purchased hi other countries. For them life went on,
                              one way or another. The fruits of overseas conquest enriched the
                              ruling class and the towns rather than the mass of ordinary people who
                              lived as peasants. In this sense, First Wave

                              imperialism was still petty—not yet integrated into the economy.

                              The Second Wave transformed this relatively small-scale pilferage into
                              big business. It transformed Petty Imperialism into Grand Imperialism.

                              Here was a new imperialism aimed not at bringing back a few
                              trunkloads of gold or emeralds, spices and silks. Here was an
                              imperialism that ultimately brought back shipload after shipload of
                              nitrates, cotton, palm oil, tin, rubber, bauxite, and tungsten. Here was
                              an imperialism that dug copper mines in the Congo and planted oil rigs
                              hi Arabia. Here was an imperialism that sucked in raw materials from
                              the colonies, processed them, and very often spewed the finished
                              manufactured goods back into the colonies at a huge profit. Here, in
                              short, was imperialism no longer peripheral but so integrated into the
                              basic economic structure of the industrial nation that the jobs of
                              millions of ordinary workers came to depend on it

                              And not just jobs. In addition to new raw materials, Europe also
                              needed increasing amounts of food. As Second Wave nations turned
                              to manufacturing, transferring rural labor into the factories, they were
                              forced to import more of their foodstuffs from abroad—beef, mutton,
                              grain, coffee, tea, and sugar from India, from China, from Africa, from
                              the West Indies and Central America.

                              In turn, as mass manufacturing grew, the new industrial elites needed
                              bigger markets and fresh outlets for investment. In the 1880's and
                              1890's European statesmen were unabashedly open about their
                              objectives. "Empire is commerce,'* proclaimed the British politician
                              Joseph Chamberlain. The French premier Jules Ferry was even more
                              explicit: What France needed, he declared, were "outlets for our
                              industries, exports, and capital." Jolted by cycles of boom and bust,
                              faced with chronic unemployment, European leaders were for
                              generations obsessed by the fear that if colonial expansion stopped,
                              unemployment would lead to armed revolution at home.

                              The roots of Grand Imperialism were, however, more than economic.
                              Strategic considerations, religious fervor, idealism, and adventure all
                              played a part, as did racism, with its implicit assumption of white or
                              European superiority. Many saw imperial conquest as a divine
                              responsibility. Kipling's phrase, the "White Man's burden," summed up
                              the European's missionary zeal to spread Christianity and
                              "civilization"—]]></page><page Index="71"><![CDATA[86 THE THIRD WAVE

                              meaning, of course, Second Wave civilization. For the colonizers
                              regarded First Wave civilizations, no matter how refined and complex,
                              as backward and underdeveloped. Rural people, especially if they
                              happened to wear dark skins, were supposedly childlike. They were
                              "tricky and dishonest." They were "shiftless." They did not "value life."

                              Such attitudes made it easier for the Second Wave forces to justify the
                              annihilation of those who stood in their path.

                              In The Social History of the Machine Gun, John Ellis shows how this
                              new, fantastically deadly weapon, perfected in the nineteenth century,
                              was at first systematically employed against "native" populations and
                              not against white Europeans, since it was considered unsportsmanlike
                              to kill an equal with it. Shooting colonials, however, was thought to be
                              more like a hunt than a war, so other standards applied. "Mowing down
                              Matabeles, Dervishes or Tibetans," writes Ellis, "was regarded more as
                              a rather risky kind of 'shoot' than a true military operation."

                              At Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, this superior technology
                              was displayed with withering effect in 1898 when Dervish warriors led
                              by the Mahdi were defeated by British troops armed with six Maxim
                              machine guns. An eyewitness wrote: "It was the last day of Mahdism
                              and the greatest. ... It was not a battle but an execution." In that one
                              engagement twenty-eight British died, leaving behind eleven thousand
                              Dervish dead—392 colonial casualities for every Englishman. Writes
                              Ellis: "It became another example of the triumph of the British spirit,
                              and the general superiority of the white man."

                              Behind the racist attitudes and the religious and other justifications as
                              the British, French, Germans. Dutch, and others spread around the
                              world, stood a single hard reality. Second Wave civilization could not
                              exist in isolation. It desperately needed the hidden subsidy of cheap
                              resources from the outside. Above all, it needed a single integrated
                              world market through which to siphon those subsidies.

                              GAS PUMPS IN THE GARDEN

                              The thrust to create this integrated world market was based on the
                              idea, best expressed by David Ricardo, that the division of labor ought
                              to be applied to nations as well as to factory workers. In a classical
                              passage he pointed out that if

                              87

                              Britain specialized in the manufacture of textiles and Portugal in
                              making wine, both countries would gain. Each would be doing what it
                              did best. Thus the "international division of tabor," assigning
                              specialized roles to different nations, would enrich everyone.

                              This belief hardened into dogma in the generations that followed and
                              still prevails today, although its implications often go unnoticed. For just]]></page><page Index="72"><![CDATA[as the division of labor in any economy created a powerful need for
                              integration and thereby gave rise to an integrational elite, so the
                              international division of labor required integration on a global scale and
                              gave rise to a global elite—a small group of Second Wave nations
                              which, for all practical purposes, took turns dominating large parts of
                              the rest of the world.

                              The success of the drive to create a single integrated world market can
                              be measured in the fantastic growth of world trade once the Second
                              Wave passed through Europe. Between 1750 and 1914 the value of
                              world trade is estimated to have multiplied more than fiftyfold, rising
                              from 700 million dollars to almost 40 billion dollars. If Ricardo had been
                              right, the advantages of this global trade should have accrued more or
                              less evenly to all sides. In fact, the self-serving belief that specialization
                              would benefit everyone was based on a fantasy of fair competition.

                              It presupposed a completely efficient use of labor and resources. It
                              presupposed deals uncontaminated by threats of political or military
                              force. It presupposed armVlength transactions by more or less evenly
                              matched bargainers. The theory, in short, overlooked nothing—except
                              real life.

                              In reality, negotiations between Second Wave merchants and First
                              Wave people over sugar, copper, cocoa, or other resources were often
                              totally lopsided. On one side of the table sat money-shrewd European
                              or American traders backed by huge companies, extensive banking
                              networks, powerful technologies, and strong national governments. On
                              the other one might find a local lord or tribal chieftain whose people
                              had scarcely entered the money system and whose economy was
                              based on small-scale agriculture or village crafts. On one side sat the
                              agents of a thrusting, alien, mechanically advanced civilization,
                              convinced of its own superiority and ready to use bayonets or machine
                              guns to prove it. On the other sat representatives of small prenational
                              tribes or principalities, armed with arrows and spears.

                              Often local rulers or entrepreneurs were simply bought off

                              by the Westerners, offered bribes or personal gain in return for
                              sweating the native labor force, putting down resistance, or rewriting
                              local laws in favor of the outsiders. Once conquering a colony, the
                              imperial power often set preferential raw-material prices for its own
                              businessmen and erected stiff barriers to prevent the traders of rival
                              nations from bidding prices up.

                              Under such circumstances, it was hardly surprising that the industrial
                              world was able to obtain raw materials or energy resources at less
                              than fair-market prices.

                              Beyond this, prices were often further depressed in the favor of the
                              buyers by what might be termed "The Law of the First Price." Many raw
                              materials needed by Second Wave nations were virtually valueless to
                              the First Wave populations who had them. African peasants had no
                              need for chromium. Arab sheiks had no use for the black gold that lay
                              under their desert sands.]]></page><page Index="73"><![CDATA[Where no previous history of trade existed for a given commodity, the
                              price set in the first transaction was crucial. And this price was often
                              based less on such economic factors as cost, profit, or competition
                              than on relative military and political strength. Typically set in the
                              absence of active competition, almost any price was acceptable to
                              ajord or tribal chief who regarded his local resources as valueless and
                              found himself facing a regiment of troops with Galling guns. And this
                              First Price, once established at a low level, depressed all subsequent
                              prices.

                              As soon as this raw material was shipped back to the industrial nations
                              and incorporated in final products, the low initial price was, for all
                              intents, frozen in place.* Eventually, as a world price was gradually
                              established for each commodity, all industrial nations benefited from
                              the fact that the First Price had been set at an "a-competitive" low
                              level. For many different reasons, therefore, despite much imperialist
                              rhetoric about the virtues of free trade and enterprise, the Second

                              * Example: Suppose Company A bought a raw material from Colonia
                              for one dollar a pound, then used it to manufacture widgets selling for
                              two dollars each. Any other company seeking to enter the widget
                              market would strive to keep its own raw-material cost at, or below, that
                              of Company A. Unless it had some technological or other edge, it could
                              not afford to pay significantly more for its raw material and still sell
                              widgets at a competitive price. Thus the initial price set for the raw
                              material, even if arrived at under the shadow of bayonets, became the
                              base for all subsequent negotiation.

                              Wave nations profited greatly from what was euphemistically called
                              "imperfect competition."

                              Rhetoric and Ricardo aside, the benefits of expanding trade were not
                              evenly shared. They flowed mainly from the First Wave world to the
                              Second.

                              THE MARGARINE PLANTATION

                              To facilitate this flow, the industrial powers worked hard to expand and
                              integrate the world market As trade passed beyond national
                              boundaries each national market became part of a larger set of
                              interconnected regional or continental markets and, finally, part of the
                              single, unified exchange system envisioned by the integrational elites
                              who ran Second Wave civilization. A single web of money was woven
                              around the world.

                              Treating the rest of the world as its gas pump, garden, mine, quarry,
                              and cheap labor supply, the Second Wave world wrought deep
                              changes in the social life of the earth's non-industrial populations.
                              Cultures that had subsisted for thousands of years in a self-sufficient
                              manner, producing their own food supplies, were sucked willy-nilly into
                              the world trade system and compelled to trade or perish. Suddenly the]]></page><page Index="74"><![CDATA[living standards of Bolivians or Malayans were tied to the requirements

                              The innocent household product margarine provides a dramatic case
                              in point. Margarine was originally manufactured in Europe out of local
                              materials. It grew so popular, however, that these materials proved
                              insufficient. In 1907 researchers discovered that margarine could be
                              made out of coconut and palm-kernel oil. The result of this European
                              discovery was an upheaval hi the life-style of West Africans.

                              "In the main areas of West Africa," writes Magnus Pyke, former
                              president of the British Institute of Food Science and Technology,
                              "where palm oil was traditionally produced, the land was owned by the
                              community as a whole." Complex local customs and rules governed
                              the use of the palm trees. Sometimes a man who had planted a tree
                              was entitled to its product for the rest of his life. In some places women
                              had special rights. According to Pyke, the Western businessmen who
                              organized "the large-scale production of palm oil for the

                              manufacture of margarine as a 'convenience* food for the industrial
                              citizens of Europe and America destroyed the fragile and complex
                              social system of the non-industrial Africans." Huge plantations were set
                              up in the Belgian Congo, in Nigeria, the Cameroons, and the Gold
                              Coast. The West got its margarine. And Africans became semi-slaves
                              on huge plantations.

                              Rubber offers another example. After the turn of the century when
                              automobile production in the United States created a sudden heavy
                              demand for rubber for tires and inner tubes, traders, in collusion with
                              local authorities, enslaved Amazonian Indians to produce it. Roger
                              Casement, the British consul in Rio de Janeiro, reported that the
                              production of four thousand tons of Putumayo rubber between 1900
                              and 1911 resulted in the death of thirty thousand Indians.

                              It can be argued that these were "excesses" and were not typical of
                              Grand Imperialism. Certainly the colonial powers were not unrelievedly
                              cruel or evil. In places they did build schools and rudimentary health
                              facilities for their subject populations. They improved sanitation and
                              water supplies. They no doubt raised the living standard for some.

                              Nor would it be fair to romanticize precolonial societies or to blame the
                              poverty of today's non-industrial populations exclusively on
                              imperialism. Climate, local corruption and tyranny, ignorance, and
                              xenophobia all contributed. There was plenty of misery and oppression
                              to go around long before the Europeans ever arrived.

                              Nevertheless, once torn out of self-sufficiency and compelled to
                              produce for money and exchange, once encouraged or forced to
                              reorganize their social structure around mining, for example, or
                              plantation fanning, First Wave populations were plunged into economic

                              suppressed. Moreover, the colonial powers hammered a deep sense
                              of psychological inferiority into the conquered people that stands even
                              today as an obstacle to economic and social development.

                              In the Second Wave world, however, Grand Imperialism paid off
                              handsomely. As the economic historian William Woodruff put it: "It was
                              the exploitation of these territories and the growing trade done with
                              them that obtained for the European family wealth on a scale never
                              seen before." Built deep into the very structure of the Second Wave
                              economy,

                              91

                              feeding its ravenous need for resources, imperialism marched across
                              the planet.

                              In 1492 when Columbus first set foot in the New World, Europeans
                              controlled only 9 percent of the globe. By 1801 they ruled a third. By
                              1880, two thirds. And by 1935 Europeans politically controlled 85
                              percent of the land surface of the earth and 70 percent of its
                              population. Like Second Wave society itself, the world was divided into
                              integrators and inte-gratees.

                              INTEGRATION A L'AMERICAIN

                              Not all integrators were equal, however. The Second Wave nations
                              waged an increasingly bloody battle among themselves for control of
                              the emerging world economic system. English and French dominance
                              was challenged in World War I by rising German industrial might. The
                              war's destruction, the devastating cycle of inflation and depression that
                              followed it, the revolution in Russia, all shook the industrial world
                              market.

                              These upheavals brought on a drastic slowdown in the rate of growth
                              of world trade, and, even though more countries were sucked into the
                              trading system, the actual volume of goods traded internationally
                              declined. World War II further slowed extension of the integrated world
                              market.

                              By the end of World War II, Western Europe lay in smoking ruins.
                              Germany had been reduced to a lunar landscape. The Soviet Union
                              had suffered indescribable physical and human damage. Japan's
                              industry was shattered. Of the major industrial powers only the United
                              States found itself unharmed economically. By 1946-1950 the global
                              economy stood in such disarray that foreign trade was at its lowest
                              level since 1913.

                              Moreover, the very weakness of the war-stricken European powers
                              encouraged one colony after another to demand political
                              independence. Gandhi, Ho Chi Minh, Jomo Kenyatta, and other anti-
                              colonialists stepped up their campaigns to oust the, colonizers.]]></page><page Index="76"><![CDATA[Even before the wartime guns stopped firing, therefore, it was apparent

                              and reintegrating the Second Wave system: the United States and the
                              Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

                              The United States until then had played a limited part in the Grand
                              Imperial campaign. In opening its own frontier it had decimated the
                              Native Americans and cordoned them off in reservations. In Mexico,
                              Cuba, and Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, Americans imitated the
                              imperial tactics of the British, the French, or the Germans. In Latin
                              America throughout the early decades of this century U.S. "dollar
                              diplomacy" helped United Fruit and other corporations guarantee low
                              prices for sugar, bananas, coffee, copper, and other goods.
                              Nevertheless, compared with the Europeans, the United States was a
                              junior partner in the Grand Imperial crusade.

                              After World War II, by contrast, the United States stood as the chief
                              creditor nation in the world. It had the most advanced technology, the
                              most stable political structure—and an irresistible opportunity to move
                              into the power vacuum left behind by its shattered competitors as they
                              were forced to withdraw from the colonies.

                              As early as 1941 U.S. financial strategists had begun to plan for a
                              postwar reintegration of the world economy along lines more favorable
                              to the United States. At the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, held
                              under U.S. leadership, forty-four nations agreed to set up two key
                              integrative structures—the International Monetary Fund and the World
                              Bank.

                              The IMF compelled its member nations to peg then* currency to the
                              American dollar or to gold—most of which was held by the United
                              States. (By 1948, the United States possessed 72 percent of the whole
                              world's gold reserves.) The IMF thus fixed the basic relationships of the
                              major world currencies.

                              The World Bank, meanwhile, at first established to provide postwar
                              reconstruction funds to European nations, gradually began providing
                              loans to the non-industrial countries, too. These were often for the
                              purpose of building roads, harbors, ports, and other "infra-structure
                              items" to facilitate the movement of raw materials and agricultural
                              exports to the Second Wave nations.

                              Soon a third component was added to the system: the General
                              Agreement on Tariffs and Trade—GATT for short. This agreement,
                              again promoted originally by the United States, set out to liberalize
                              trade, which had the effect of

                              countries to protect then* tiny fledgling industries.

                              The three structures were wired together by a rule that prohibited the
                              World Bank from making loans to any country that refused to join the
                              IMF or to abide by the GATT.

                              This system made it difficult for debtors of the United States to reduce
                              then* obligations through currency or tariff manipulation. It
                              strengthened the competitiveness of U.S. industry in world markets.
                              And it gave the industrial powers, and especially the United States, a
                              strong influence on economic planning in many First Wave countries,
                              even after they had attained political independence.

                              These three interconnected agencies formed a single inte-grative
                              structure for world trade. And from 1944 to the early 1970's, the United
                              States basically dominated this system. Among nations, it integrated
                              the integrators.

                              SOCIALIST IMPERIALISM

                              American leadership of the Second Wave world, however, was
                              increasingly challenged by the rise of the Soviet Union. The U.S.S.R.
                              and other socialist nations portrayed themselves as anti-imperialist
                              friends of the colonial peoples of the world. In 1916, a year before he
                              took power, Lenin had written a slashing attack on the capitalist
                              nations for their colonial policies. His Imperialism became one of the
                              most influential books of the century and still shapes the thinking of
                              hundreds of millions around the world.

                              But Lenin saw imperialism as a purely capitalist phenomenon.
                              Capitalist nations, he insisted, oppressed and colonized other nations
                              not out of choice but out of necessity. A dubious iron law, put forward
                              by Marx, held that profits in capitalist economies showed a general,
                              irresistible tendency to decline over time. Because of this, Lenin held,
                              capitalist nations in their final stage were driven to seek "super-profits"
                              abroad to compensate for diminishing profits at home. Only socialism,
                              he argued, would free colonial peoples from their oppression and
                              misery, because socialism had no built-in dynamic requiring their
                              economic exploitation.

                              What Lenin overlooked is that many of the same imperatives that
                              drove capitalist industrial nations operated in socialist industrial nations
                              as well. They, too, were part of the world money system. They, too,
                              based their economies on the

                              divorce of production from consumption. They, too, needed a market
                              (albeit not necessarily a profit-oriented market) to reconnect producer
                              and consumer. They, too, needed raw materials from abroad to feed
                              their industrial machines. And for these reasons they, too, needed an
                              integrated world economic system through which to obtain their
                              necessities and sell their products abroad.]]></page><page Index="78"><![CDATA[Indeed Lenin, at the very same time he attacked imperialism, spoke of
                              socialism's aim "not only to bring the nations closer together but to
                              integrate them." As the Soviet analyst M. Senin has written in Socialist
                              Integration, Lenin by 1920 "regarded the drawing together of nations
                              as an objective process which . . . will finally and ultimately lead to the
                              creation of a single world economy, regulated by ... a common plan."
                              This, if anything, was lie ultimate industrial vision.

                              Externally, socialist industrial nations were driven by the same
                              resource needs as capitalist nations. They, too, needed cotton, coffee,
                              nickel, sugar, wheat, and other goods to feed their fast-multiplying
                              factories and their urban populations. The Soviet Union had (and still
                              has) enormous reserves of natural resources. It has manganese, lead,
                              zinc, coal, phosphates, and gold. But so had the United States, and
                              that stopped neither nation from seeking to buy from others at the
                              cheapest possible price.

                              From its inception the Soviet Union became part of the world money
                              system. Once any nation entered this system and accepted the
                              "normal" ways of doing business, it immediately locked itself into
                              conventional definitions of efficiency and productivity—definitions that
                              were themselves traceable back to early capitalism. It was compelled
                              to accept, almost unconsciously, conventional economic concepts,
                              categories, definitions, accounting methods, and units of
                              measurement.

                              Socialist managers and economists, exactly like their capitalist
                              counterparts, thus calculated the cost of producing their own raw
                              materials as against the cost of purchasing them. They faced a straight
                              "make or buy" decision of the kind capitalist corporations confront
                              every day. And it soon became apparent that buying certain raw
                              materials on the world market would be cheaper than trying to produce
                              them at home.

                              Once this decision was made, sharp Soviet purchasing agents fanned
                              out into the world market and bought at prices previously set at
                              artificially low levels by imperialist traders. Soviet trucks rolled on
                              rubber bought at prices that were

                              probably determined ab initio by British merchants in Malaya. Worse,
                              in recent years the Soviets (who maintain troops there) paid Guinea six
                              dollars per ton for bauxite when the Americans were paying twenty-
                              three dollars. India has protested that the Russians overcharge them
                              30 percent on imports and pay 30 percent too little for Indian exports.
                              Iran and Afghanistan received subnormal prices from the Soviets for
                              natural gas. Thus the Soviet Union, like its capitalist adversaries,
                              benefited at the expense of the colonies. To have done otherwise
                              would have been to slow its own industrialization process.

                              The Soviet Union was also driven toward imperialist policies by
                              strategic considerations. Faced with the military might of Nazi]]></page><page Index="79"><![CDATA[Germany, the Soviets first colonized the Baltic states and made war on
                              Finland. After World War II, with troops and the threat of invasion, they
                              helped install or maintain "friendly" regimes throughout most of Eastern
                              Europe. These countries, more industrially advanced than the U.S.S.R.
                              itself, were intermittently milked by the Soviets, justifying their
                              description as colonies or "satellites."

                              "There can be no doubt," writes the neo-Marxist economist Howard
                              Sherman, "that, in the years immediately following the Second World
                              War, the Soviet Union removed a certain amount of resources from
                              Eastern Europe without giving equal resources in payment . . . There
                              was some direct plunder and military reparation. . . . There were also
                              joint companies established with Soviet predominance hi control and
                              Soviet exploitation of profits from these countries. There were also
                              extremely unequal trade agreements that amounted to further
                              reparations."

                              At present there is apparently no direct plunder and the joint
                              companies have disappeared, but, adds Sherman, "There is much
                              evidence that most of the exchanges between the U.S.S.R. and most
                              East European countries are still unequal—with the U.S.S.R. coming
                              out best." How much "profit" is extruded by these means is difficult to
                              determine, given the inadequacy of published Soviet statistics. It may
                              well be that the costs of maintaining Soviet troops throughout Eastern
                              Europe actually outweigh the economic benefits. But one.fact is

                              Soviets moved toward Lenin's dream of a single integrated world

                              forced by Moscow not only to trade with one another and with the
                              Soviet Union but to submit their economic development plans to
                              Moscow for approval. Moscow, insisting on the Ricardiaji virtues of
                              specialization, acting exactly like the old imperialist powers vis-a-vis
                              African, Asian, or Latin American economies, has assigned specialized
                              functions to each Eastern European economy. Only Romania has
                              openly and staunchly resisted.

                              Claiming that Moscow has tried to turn it into the "petrol pump and
                              garden" of the Soviet Union, Romania has set out to achieve what it
                              calls multilateral development, meaning a fully rounded
                              industrialization. It has resisted "socialist integration" despite Soviet
                              pressures. In sum, at the very time that the United States assumed
                              leadership of the capitalist industrial nations and built its own self-
                              serving mechanisms for integrating the world economic system anew
                              after World War II, the Soviets built a counterpart of this system in the
                              part of the world they dominated.

                              positive accomplishments to its credit as well as atrocities. But its role
                              in the rise of Second Wave civilisation cannot be overemphasized.

                              We can think of imperialism as the supercharger or accelerator of
                              industrial development in the Second Wave world. How rapidly would
                              the United States, Western Europe, Japan, or the U.S.S.R. have been
                              able to industrialize without infusions of food, energy, and raw
                              materials from outside? What if the prices of scores of commodities
                              like bauxite, manganese, tin, vanadium, or copper had been 30 to 50
                              percent higher for a period of decades?

                              The price of thousands of end-products would have been
                              correspondingly higher—in some cases, no doubt, so high as to make
                              mass consumption impossible. The shock of oil price increases in the
                              early 1970's gives only a pale hint of the potential effects.

                              Even if domestic substitutes had been available, the economic growth
                              of the Second Wave nations would in all probability have been stunted.

                              sidles made possible by imperialism, capitalist and socialist, Second
                              Wave civilization might well be today where it was in 1920 or 1930.

                              The grand design should now be clear. Second Wave civilization cut
                              up and organized the world into discrete nation-states. Needing the
                              resources of the rest of the world, it drew First Wave societies and the
                              remaining primitive peoples of the world into the money system. It
                              created a globally integrated marketplace. But rampant industrialism
                              was more than an economic, political, or social system. It was also a
                              way of life and a way of thinking. It produced a Second Wave
                              mentality.

                              This mentality stands today as a key obstacle to the creation of a
                              workable Third Wave civilization.

                              INDUST-REALITY

                              As Second Wave civilization pushed its tentacles across the planet,
                              transforming everything with which it came in contact, it carried with it
                              more than technology or trade. Colliding with First Wave civilization,
                              the Second Wave created hot only a new reality for millions but a new
                              way of thinking about reality.

                              Clashing at a thousand points with the values, concepts, myths, and
                              morals of agricultural society, the Second Wave brought with it a
                              redefinition of God ... of justice ... of love ... of power ... of beauty. It
                              stirred up new ideas, attitudes, and analogies. It subverted and
                              superseded ancient assumptions about time, space, matter, and
                              causality. A powerful, coherent world view emerged that not only]]></page><page Index="81"><![CDATA[explained but justified Second Wave reality. This world view of
                              industrial society has not had a name. It might best be termed "indust-
                              reality."

                              Indust-reality was the overarching set of ideas and assumptions with
                              which the children of industrialism were taught to understand then*
                              world. It was the package of premises employed by Second Wave
                              civilization, by its scientists, business leaders, statesmen,
                              philosophers, and propagandists.

                              There were, of course, countervoices, those who challenged the
                              dominant ideas of indust-reality, but we are concerned here not with
                              the side currents but with the mainstream of Second Wave thought. On
                              the surface, it seemed, there was no mainstream at all. Rather, it
                              appeared that there were two powerful ideological currents in conflict.
                              By the middle of the nineteenth century every industrializing nation had
                              its sharply 98

                              enterprise, and its advocates of collectivism and socialism.

                              This battle of ideologies, at first confined to the industrializing nations
                              themselves, soon spread around the globe. With the Soviet Revolution
                              of 1917, and the organization of a centrally directed worldwide
                              propaganda machine, the ideological struggle grew even more intense.
                              And by the end of World War II, as the United States and the Soviet
                              Union attempted to reintegrate the world market—or large parts of it—
                              on their own terms, each side was spending huge sums to spread its
                              doctrines to the world's non-industrial peoples.

                              On one side were totalitarian regimes, on the other the so-called liberal
                              democracies. Guns and bombs stood ready to take up where logical
                              arguments ended. Seldom since the great collision of Catholicism and
                              Protestantism during the Reformation had doctrinal lines been so
                              sharply drawn between two theological camps.

                              What few noticed, however, in the heat of this propaganda war, was
                              that while each side promoted a different ideology, both were
                              essentially hawking the same superideolagy. Their conclusions—their
                              economic programs and political dogmas—differed radically, but many
                              of their starting assump? tions were the same. Like Protestant and
                              Catholic missionaries clutching different versions of the Bible, yet both
                              preaching Christ, Marxists and anti-Marxists alike, capitalists and
                              anticapitalists, Americans and Russians marched forth into Africa,
                              Asia, and Latin America—the non-industrial regions of the world—
                              blindly bearing the same set of fundamental premises. Both preached
                              the superiority of industrialism to all other civilizations. Both were
                              passionate apostles of indust-reality.

                              The first of these core beliefs had to do with nature. While socialists
                              and capitalists might disagree violently about how to share its fruits,
                              both looked upon nature in the same way. For both, nature was an
                              object waiting to be exploited. I

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              The idea that humans should hold dominion over nature can be traced
                              at least as far back as Genesis. Nevertheless, it was decidedly a
                              minority view until the industrial revolution. Most earlier cultures
                              emphasized instead an acceptance of poverty and the harmony of
                              humankind with its surrounding natural ecology.

                              These earlier cultures were not particularly gentle with nature. They
                              slashed and burned, overgrazed, and stripped the forests for firewood.
                              But their power to do damage was limited. They had no great impact
                              on the earth and no need for an explicit ideology to justify the damage
                              they did.

                              With the coming of Second Wave civilization one found capitalist
                              industrialists gouging resources on a massive scale, pumping
                              voluminous poisons into the air, deforesting whole regions in pursuit of
                              profit, without much thought about side effects or long-term
                              consequences. The idea that nature was there to be exploited provided
                              a convenient rationalization for shortsightedness and selfishness.

                              But the capitalists were scarcely alone. Wherever they took power,
                              Marxist industrializers (despite their conviction that profit was the root
                              of all evil) acted hi exactly the same way. Indeed, they built the conflict
                              with nature right into their scriptures.

                              Marxists pictured primitive peoples not as coexisting harmoniously with
                              nature but as engaged in a fierce lif e-and-death struggle against it.
                              With the emergence of class society, they held, the war of "man
                              against nature" was unfortunately transformed into a war of "man
                              against man." The achievement of a Communist classless society
                              would permit humanity to get back to its first order of business once
                              again—the war of man against nature.

                              On both sides of the ideological divide, therefore, one found the same
                              image of humanity standing hi opposition to nature and dominating it.
                              This image was a key component of indust-reality, the superideology
                              from which Marxist and anti-Marxist alike drew their assumptions.

                              A second, interrelated idea carried the argument a step fur-er. Humans
                              were not merely in charge of nature, they were the pinnacle of a long
                              process of evolution. Earlier theories of evolution existed, but it was

                              lection'*—an inevitable process that mercilessly weeded out weak and
                              inefficient forms of life. Those species who survived were, by definition,
                              the fittest.

                              Darwin was chiefly concerned with biological evolution, but his ideas
                              had distinct social and political overtones that others were quick to
                              recognize. Thus the Social Darwinists argued that the principle of
                              natural selection worked within society as well, and that the wealthiest
                              and most powerful people were, by virtue of that fact, the fittest and the
                              most deserving.

                              It was only a short leap to the idea that whole societies evolve
                              according to the same laws of selection. Following this reasoning,
                              industrialism was a higher stage of evolution than the non-industrial
                              cultures that surrounded it. Second Wave civilization, to put it bluntly,
                              was superior to all the rest.

                              Just as Social Darwinism rationalized capitalism, this cultural
                              arrogance rationalized imperialism. The expanding industrial order
                              needed its lifeline to cheap resources, and it created a moral
                              justification for taking them at depressed prices, even at the cost of
                              obliterating agricultural and so-called primitive societies. The idea of
                              social evolution provided intellectual and moral support for the
                              treatment of non-industrial peoples as inferior—and hence unfitted for
                              survival.

                              Darwin himself wrote unfeelingly of the massacre of the aborigines of
                              Tasmania and, in a burst of genocidal enthusiasm, prophesied that "At
                              some future period ... the civilized races of man will almost certainly
                              exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world." The
                              intellectual front-runners of Second Wave civilization had no doubt
                              about who deserved to survive.

                              While Marx bitterly criticized capitalism and imperialism, he shared the
                              view that industrialism was the most advanced form of society, the
                              stage toward which all other societies would inevitably advance in turn.

                              For the third core belief of indust-reality that linked nature and
                              evolution together was the progress principle—the idea that history
                              flows irreversibly toward a better life for humanity. This idea, too, had
                              plenty of preindustrial precedent. But it was only with the advance of
                              the Second Wave that the idea of Progress with a capital P burst into
                              full flower.

                              Suddenly, as the Second Wave pulsed over Europe a thousand throats
                              began to sing the same hallelujah chorus. Leibniz, Turgot, Condorcet,
                              Kant, Lessing, John Stuart Mill,

                              102 THE THIRD WAVE]]></page><page Index="84"><![CDATA[Hegel, Marx, Darwin, and countless lesser thinkers all found reasons
                              for cosmic optimism. They argued over whether progress was truly
                              inevitable or whether it needed a helping hand from the human race;
                              over what constituted a better life; over whether progress would or
                              could continue ad infi-nitum. But they all nodded in agreement at the
                              notion of progress itself.

                              Atheists and divines, students and professors, politicians and scientists
                              preached the new faith. Businessmen and commissars alike heralded
                              each new factory, each new product, each new housing development,
                              highway, or dam as evidence of this irresistible advance from bad to
                              good or good to better. Poets, playwrights, and painters took progress
                              for granted. Progress justified the degradation of nature and the
                              conquest of "less advanced" civilizations.

                              And once more the same idea ran parallel through the works of both
                              Adam Smith and Karl Marx. As Robert Heil-broner has noted, "Smith
                              was a believer hi progress. ... In The Wealth of Nations progress was
                              no longer an idealistic goal of mankind, but ... a destination to which it
                              was driven ... a by-product of private economic aims." For Marx, of
                              course, these private aims produced only capitalism and the seeds of
                              its own destruction. But this event in itself was part of the long
                              historical sweep carrying humanity forward to socialism, communism,
                              and an even better beyond. Throughout Second Wave civilization,
                              therefore, three key concepts—the war with nature, the importance of
                              evolution, and the progress principle—provided the ammunition used
                              by the agents of industrialism as they explained and justified it to the
                              world.

                              Beneath these convictions lay still deeper assumptions about reality—
                              a set of unspoken beliefs about the very ele-mentals of human
                              experience. Every human being must deal with these elementals, and
                              every civilization describes them in a different way. Every civilization
                              must teach its children to grapple with tune and space. It must
                              explain—whether through myth, metaphor, or scientific theory—how
                              nature works. And it must offer some clue to why things happen as
                              they do.

                              Thus Second Wave civilization, as it matured, created a wholly new
                              image of reality, based on its own distinctive assumptions about time
                              and space, matter and cause. Picking up fragments from the past,
                              piecing them together in new

                              ways, applying experiment and empirical tests, it drastically altered the
                              way human beings came to perceive the world around them and how
                              they behaved in their daily lives.

                              THE SOFTWARE OF TIME

                              We have seen in an earlier chapter how the spread of industrialism
                              was dependent upon the synchronization of human behavior with the]]></page><page Index="85"><![CDATA[rhythms of the machine. Synchronization was on© of the- guiding
                              principles of Second Wave civilization, and everywhere the people of
                              industrialism appeared to outsiders to be time-obsessed, always
                              glancing nervously at their watches.

                              To bring about this time-consciousness and achieve synchronization,
                              however, people's basic assumptions about time —their mental images
                              of time—had to be transformed. A new "software of time" was needed.

                              Agricultural populations, needing to know when to plant and when to
                              harvest, developed remarkable precision in the measurement of long
                              spans of time. But because they did not require close synchronization
                              of human labor, peasant peoples seldom developed precise units for
                              measuring short spans. They typically divided time not into fixed units,
                              like hours or minutes, but into loose, imprecise chunks representing
                              the length of time needed to perform some homely task. A farmer
                              might refer to an interval as "a cow milking time." In Madagascar, an
                              accepted unit of time was called "a rice cooking"; a moment was
                              known as "the frying of a locust" Englishmen spoke of a "pater noster
                              wyle"—the tune needed for a prayer—or, more earthily, of a "pissing
                              while."

                              Similarly, because there was little exchange between one community
                              or village and the next, and because work did not require it, the units in
                              which time was mentally packaged varied from place to place and
                              season to season. In medieval northern Europe, for example, daylight
                              was divided into equal hours. But since the interval between dawn and
                              sunset varied from day to day, an "hour" in December was shorter than
                              an "hour" in March or June.

                              Instead of vague intervals like a pater noster wyle, industrial societies
                              needed extremely precise units like hour, minute, or second. And these
                              units had to be standardized, interchangeable from one season or
                              community to the next. Today the entire world is neatly divided into
                              time zones.

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              We speak of "standard" time. Pilots all over the globe refer back to
                              "Zulu" time—i.e., Greenwich Mean Time. By international convention
                              Greenwich, England, became the point from which all time differences
                              would be measured. Periodically, hi unison, as though motivated by a
                              single will, millions of people set their clocks back or forward an hour,
                              and whatever our inner, subjective sense of things may tell us when
                              time is dragging, or conversely when it seems to be whizzing by, an
                              hour is now a single interchangeable, standardized hour.

                              Second Wave civilization did more than cut tune up into more precise
                              and standard chunks. It also placed these chunks in a straight line that
                              extended indefinitely back into the past and forward into the future. It
                              made time linear.

                              Indeed, the assumption that time is linelike is so deeply embedded in
                              our thoughts that it is hard for those of us raised hi Second Wave]]></page><page Index="86"><![CDATA[societies to conceive of any alternative. Yet many preindustrial
                              societies, and some First Wave societies even today, see time as a
                              circle, not a straight line. From the Mayas to the Buddhists and the
                              Hindus, time was circular and repetitive, history repeating itself
                              endlessly, lives perhaps reliving themselves through reincarnation.

                              The idea that time was like a great circle is found in the Hindu concept
                              of recurrent kalpas, each one four thousand million years long, each
                              representing but a single Brahma day beginning with re-creation,
                              ending hi dissolution, and beginning again. The notion of circular time
                              is found in Plato and Aristotle, one of whose students, Eudemus,
                              pictured himself living through the same moment again and again as
                              the cycle repeated itself. It was taught by Pythagoras. In Time and
                              Eastern Man, Joseph Needham tells us that "For the Indo-Hellenic . . .
                              time is cyclical and eternal.*' Moreover, while in China the idea of linear
                              time dominated, according to Needham, "Cyclical time was certainly
                              prominent among the early Taoist speculative philosophers."

                              In Europe, too, in the centuries preceding industrialization, these
                              alternative views of time coexisted. "Throughout the whole medieval
                              period," writes mathematician G. J. Whit-row, "the cyclic and linear
                              concepts of time were in conflict The linear concept was fostered by
                              the mercantile class and the rise of a money economy. For as long as
                              power was concentrated in the ownership of land, time was felt to be
                              plentiful and was associated with the unchanging cycle of the soil."

                              As the Second Wave gathered force this age-old conflict was settled:
                              linear time triumphed. Linear time became the dominant view in every
                              industrial society. East or West. Time came to be seen as a highway

                              industrial civilization, became the basis of all economic, scientific, and
                              political planning, whether in the executive suite of IBM, the Japanese
                              Economic Planning Agency, or the Soviet Academy.

                              It is worth noting, however, that linear time was a precondition for
                              indust-real views of evolution and progress. Linear time made
                              evolution and progress plausible. For if time were circular instead of
                              linelike, if events doubled back on themselves instead of moving in a
                              single direction, it would mean that history repeated itself and that
                              evolution and progress were no more than illusions—shadows on the
                              wall of time.

                              assumptions of the civilization and they brought massive changes in
                              the way ordinary people handled time in their lives. But if time itself
                              was transformed, space, too, had to be repackaged to fit into the new
                              indust-reality.

                              ancestors relied on hunting and herding, fishing, or foraging for
                              survival, they kept constantly on the move. Driven by hunger, cold, or
                              ecological mishaps, pursuing weather or game, they were the original
                              "high-mobiles"— traveling light, avoiding the accumulation of
                              cumbersome goods or property, and ranging widely over the
                              landscape. A band of fifty men, women, and children might need a land
                              area six times the size of Manhattan Island to feed them, or they might
                              trace a migratory path over literally hundreds of miles each year as
                              conditions demanded. They led what today's geographers call a
                              "spatially extensive*' existence.

                              First Wave civilization, by contrast, bred a race of "space misers." As
                              nomadism was replaced by agriculture, migratory trails gave way to
                              cultivated fields and permanent settlements. Rather than roaming
                              restlessly over an extensive area, the farmer and his family stayed put,
                              intensively working their

                              tiny patch, within the larger sea of space—a sea so large as to dwarf
                              the individual.

                              By the period immediately preceding the birth of industrial civilization,
                              vast open fields surrounded each huddle of peasant huts. Apart from a
                              handful of merchants, scholars, and soldiers, most individuals lived
                              their lives at the end of a very short tether. They walked to the fields at
                              sunrise, then back again at nightfall. They traced a path to church. On
                              rare occasions they trekked to the next village six or seven miles away.
                              Conditions varied with climate and terrain, of course, but according to
                              historian J. R. Hale, "We should probably not be far wrong if we took
                              the average longest journey made by most people in their lifetimes as
                              fifteen miles." Agriculture produced a "spatially restricted" civilization.

                              The industrial storm that broke over Europe in the eighteenth century
                              created once again a "spatially extended" culture—but now on a nearly
                              planetary scale. Goods, people, and ideas were transported thousands
                              of miles and vast populations migrated in search of jobs. Instead of
                              production being widely dispersed in the fields, it was now
                              concentrated in cities. Huge, teeming populations were compressed
                              into a few tightly packed nodes. Old villages shriveled and died;
                              booming industrial centers sprang up, rimmed with smokestacks and
                              furnace fire.

                              This dramatic reworking of the landscape required much more complex
                              coordination between city and country. Thus food, energy, people, and
                              raw materials had to flow into the urban nodes, while manufactured
                              goods, fashions, ideas, and financial decisions flowed out. The two
                              flows were carefully integrated and coordinated in time and space.
                              Within the cities themselves, moreover, a much wider variety of spatial
                              shapes was needed. In the old agricultural system the basic physical
                              structures were a church, a nobleman's palace, some wretched huts,
                              an occasional tavern or monastery. Second Wave civilization, because
                              of its much more elaborate division of labor, demanded many more
                              specialized types of space.]]></page><page Index="88"><![CDATA[Architects, for this reason, soon found themselves creating offices,

                              road sidings to docks or truck yards, the placement of schools and
                              hospitals, of water pipes, power stations, conduits, gas lines, telephone
                              exchanges—all had to be spatially coordinated. Space had to be as
                              carefully organized as a Bach fugue.

                              This remarkable coordination of specialized spaces—necessary to get
                              the right people to the right places at the right moment—was the exact
                              spatial analogue of temporal synchronization. It was, in effect,
                              synchronization in space. For both time and space had to be more
                              carefully structured if industrial societies were to function.

                              Just as people had to be provided with more exact and standardized
                              units of tune, they also needed more precise and interchangeable units
                              of space. Prior to the industrial revolution, when time was still being
                              sliced up into crude units like pater noster wyles, spatial measures,
                              too, were a mishmash. In medieval England, for example, a "rood"
                              might be as little as sixteen and a half feet or as much as twenty-four
                              feet In the sixteenth century the best advice on how to arrive at a
                              measured rood was to select sixteen men at random as they walked
                              out of church, to stand them in a line "then* left feet one behind the
                              other," and to measure off the resulting distance. Even vaguer terms
                              were used, such as "a day's ride,** "an hour's walk," or "half an hour's
                              canter."

                              Such looseness could no longer be tolerated once the Second Wave
                              began to change work patterns, and the invisible wedge created an
                              ever-expanding marketplace. Precise navigation, for example, became
                              more and more important as trade increased, and governments offered
                              huge prizes to anyone who could devise better methods of keeping
                              merchant ship? on course. On land, too, more and more refined
                              measurements and more precise units were introduced.

                              The confusing, contradictory, chaotic variety of local customs, laws,
                              and trade practices that prevailed during First Wave civilization had to
                              be cleaned up, rationalized. Lack of precision and standard
                              measurement were a daily aggravation to manufacturers and the rising
                              merchant class. This explains the enthusiasm with which the French
                              revolutionaries, at the dawn of the industrial era, applied themselves to
                              the standardization- of distance through the metric system as well as
                              time through a new calendar. So important did they deem these
                              problems that they were among the very first items taken up when the
                              National Convention first met to declare a republic.

                              The Second Wave of change also brought with it a multiplication and
                              sharpening of spatial boundaries. Until the eighteenth century the
                              boundaries of empires were often imprecise. Because vast areas were
                              unpopulated, precision was unnecessary. As population rose, trade
                              increased, and the first factories began to spring up around Europe,
                              many governments began systematically to map their frontiers.
                              Customs zones were more clearly delineated. Local and even private
                              properties came to be more carefully defined, marked, fenced, and
                              recorded. Maps became more detailed, inclusive, and standardized.

                              A new image of space arose that corresponded exactly to the new
                              image of time. As punctuality and scheduling set more limits and
                              deadlines in tune, more and more boundaries cropped up to set limits
                              in space. Even the linearization of time had its spatial counterpart.

                              In preindustrial societies straight-line travel, whether by land or sea,
                              was an anomaly. The peasant's path, the cowpath or Indian trail, all
                              meandered according to the lay of the land. Many walls curved,
                              bulged, or went off at irregular angles. The streets of medieval cities
                              folded in on one another, curved, twisted, convoluted.

                              Second Wave societies not only put ships on exact straight-line
                              courses, they also built railroads whose shining tracks stretched in
                              parallel straight lines as far as the eye could see. As the American
                              planning official Grady Clay has noted, these rail lines (the term itself is
                              a giveaway) became the axis off which new cities, built on grid
                              patterns, took shape. The grid or gridiron pattern, combining straight
                              lines with ninety-degree angles, lent a characteristic machine regularity
                              and linearity to the landscape.

                              Even now in looking at a city one can see a jumble of streets, squares,
                              circles, and complicated intersections in the older districts. These
                              frequently give way to neat gridirons in those parts of the city built hi
                              later, more industrialized periods. The same is true for whole regions
                              and countries.

                              Even farm land began, with mechanization, to show linear patterns.
                              Preindustrial farmers, plowing behind oxen, created curvy, irregular
                              furrows. Once the ox had started, the farmer did not want to stop him
                              and the beast curved wide at the end of the furrow, forming a kind of S-
                              curve pattern hi the land. Today anyone looking out the window of an
                              airplane sees squared off fields with ruler-straight plow marks.

                              was reflected not merely on the land and in the streets but in the
                              intimate spaces experienced by most men and women— the rooms
                              they lived in. Curved walls and non-right angles are seldom found in
                              industrial age architecture. Neat rectangular cubicles came to replace

                              grid patterns on the great walls facing the now straight streets.

                              Thus our conception of and experience of space went through a
                              process of linearization that paralleled the linearization of time. In all
                              industrial societies, capitalist or socialist, Eastern or Western, the
                              specialization of architectural spaces, the detailed map, the use of
                              uniform, precise units of measurement and, above all, the line, became
                              a cultural constant—basic to the new indust-reality.

                              THE "STUFF" OF REALITY

                              Second Wave civilization not only built up new images of time and
                              space and used them to shape daily behavior, it constructed its own
                              answers to the age-old question: What are things made of? Every
                              culture invents its own myths and metaphors in an attempt to answer
                              this question. For some, the universe is imagined as a swirling
                              "oneness." People are seen as a part of nature, integrally tied into the
                              lives of their ancestors and descendants, stitched into the natural world
                              so closely as to share in the actual "livingness" of animals, trees,
                              rocks, and rivers. In many societies, moreover, the individual
                              conceives of herself or himself less as a private, autonomous entity
                              than as part of a larger organism—the family, the clan, the tribe or
                              community.

                              Other societies have emphasized not the wholeness or unity of the
                              universe but its dividedness. They have looked upon reality not as a
                              fused entity but as a structure built up out of many individual parts.

                              Some two thousand years before the rise of industrialism Democritus
                              put forward the then extraordinary idea that the universe was not a
                              seamless whole but consisted of particles—discrete, indestructible,
                              irreducible, invisible, unsplit-table. He called these particles atomos. In
                              the centuries that followed, the idea of a universe built out of
                              irreducible blocks of matter appeared and reappeared. In China shortly
                              after Democritus' time, in the Mo Ching, a "point" was apparently

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              defined as a line that had been chopped into such short segments that
                              it could no longer be subdivided. In India, too, the theory of the atom or
                              irreducible unit of reality cropped up not long after the time of Christ. In
                              ancient Rome the poet Lucretius expounded the atomist philosophy.
                              Nevertheless, this image of matter remained a minority view, often
                              derided or neglected.

                              It was not until the dawn of the Second Wave era that atomism
                              became a dominating idea as several streams of intermingling
                              influences converged to revolutionize our conception of matter.

                              In the middle of the seventeenth century a French abbe" named Pierre
                              Gassendi, an astronomer and philosopher at the Royal College in
                              Paris, began arguing that matter must consist of ultra-small
                              corpuscula. Influenced by Lucretius, Gassendi became so forceful an]]></page><page Index="91"><![CDATA[advocate of the atomic view of matter that his ideas soon crossed the
                              English Channel and reached Robert Boyle, a young scientist studying
                              the compressibility of gas. Boyle transferred the idea of atomism from
                              speculative theory into the laboratory and concluded that even air itself
                              was composed of tiny particles. Six years after Gassendi's death,
                              Boyle published a treatise arguing that any substance—earth, for
                              example—that could be broken down into simpler substances is not,
                              and could not be, an element.

                              Meanwhile, Rene" Descartes, a Jesuit-trained mathematician whom
                              Gassendi criticized, contended that reality could only be understood by
                              breaking it down into smaller and smaller bits. In his own words, it was
                              necessary "to divide each of the difficulties under examination into as
                              many parts as possible." Side by side, therefore, as the Second Wave
                              began its surge, philosophical atomism advanced with physical
                              atomism.

                              Here was a deliberate assault on the notion of oneness—an assault
                              promptly joined by wave after wave of scientists, mathematicians, and
                              philosophers who proceeded to break the universe into even smaller
                              fragments, with exciting results. Once Descartes published his
                              Discourse on Method, writes the microbiologist Rene Dubos,
                              "innumerable discoveries immediately emerged from its application to
                              medicine." In chemistry and other fields the combination of atomic
                              theory and Descartes's atomic method brought startling breakthroughs.
                              By the mid-1700's the notion that the universe consisted of
                              independent separable parts and subparts was

                              INDUST-REALITY

                              111

                              itself conventional wisdom—part of the emerging indust-reality.

                              Every new civilization plucks ideas from the past and reconfigures
                              them in ways that help it understand itself in relationship to the world.
                              For a budding industrial society—a society just beginning to move
                              toward the mass production of assembled machine products
                              composed of discrete components—the idea of an assembled
                              universe, itself composed of discrete components, was probably
                              indispensable.

                              There were political and social reasons, too, for the acceptance of the
                              atomic model of reality. As the Second Wave crashed against the old
                              pre-existing First Wave institutions, it needed to tear people loose from
                              the extended family, the all-powerful church, the monarchy. Industrial
                              capitalism needed a rationale for individualism. As the old agricultural
                              civilization decayed, as trade expanded and towns multiplied in the
                              century or two before the dawn of industrialism, the rising merchant
                              classes, demanding the freedom to trade and lend and expand their
                              markets, gave rise to a new conception of the individual—the person
                              as atom.

                              The person was no longer merely a passive appendage of tribe, caste,
                              or clan but a free, autonomous individual. Each individual had the right
                              to own property, to acquire goods, to wheel and deal, to prosper, to]]></page><page Index="92"><![CDATA[starve according to his or her own active efforts, with the
                              corresponding right to choose a religion and to pursue private
                              happiness. In short, indust-real-ity gave rise to a conception of an
                              individual who was remarkably like an atom—irreducible,
                              indestructible, the basic particle of society.

                              The atomic theme even appeared, as we have seen, in politics, where
                              the vote became the ultimate particle. It appeared in our conception of
                              international affairs as consisting of self-contained, impenetrable,
                              independent units called nations. Not only physical matter but social
                              and political matter were conceived in terms of "bricks"—autonomous
                              units or atoms. The atomic theme ran through every sphere of life.

                              This view of reality as composed of organized separable chunks, in
                              turn, fitted perfectly together with the new images of time and space,
                              themselves divisible into smaller and smaller definable units. Second
                              Wave civilization, as it expanded and overpowered both "primitive"
                              societies and First Wave civilization, propagated this increasingly
                              coherent and consistent industrial view of people, politics, and society.

                              112 THE THIRD WAVE

                              One final piece was missing, however, to complete the logical system.

                              THE ULTIMATE WHY

                              Unless a civilization has some explanation for why things happen—
                              even if its explanation is nine parts mystery to one part analysis—it
                              cannot program lives effectively. People, in carrying out the
                              imperatives of their culture, need some reassurance that their behavior
                              will produce results. And this implies some answer to the perennial
                              why. Second Wave civilization came up with a theory so powerful it
                              seemed sufficient to explain everything.

                              A rock smashes into the surface of a pond. Ripples swiftly radiate out
                              across the water. Why? What causes this event? Chances are that
                              children of industrialism would say, "because someone threw it."

                              An educated European gentlemen of the twelfth or thirteenth century,
                              in attempting to answer this question, would have had ideas
                              remarkably different from our own. He probably would have relied on
                              Aristotle and searched for a material cause, a formal cause, an
                              efficient cause, and a final cause, no one of which would, by itself,
                              have been sufficient to explain anything. A medieval Chinese sage
                              might have spoken about the yin and yang, and the force-field of
                              influences in which all phenomena were believed to occur.

                              Second Wave civilization found its answer to the mysteries of
                              causation in Newton's spectacular discovery of the universal law of
                              gravitation. For Newton, causes were "the forces impressed upon
                              bodies to generate motion." The conventional example of Newtonian
                              cause and effect is the billiard balls that strike one another and move in
                              response to one another. This notion of change, which focused
                              exclusively on outside forces that are measurable and readily
                              identifiable, was extremely powerful because it dovetailed perfectly
                              with the new indust-real notions of linear space and time. Indeed,]]></page><page Index="93"><![CDATA[Newtonian or mechanistic causation, which came to be adopted as the
                              industrial revolution spread over Europe, pulled indust-reality together
                              into a hermetically sealed package.

                              If the world consisted of separate particles—miniature billiard balls—
                              then all causes arose from the interaction of these balls. One particle
                              or atom struck another. The first was the cause of the movement of the
                              next. That movement was the

                              113

                              effect of the movement of the first There was no action without motion
                              in space, and no atom could be in more than one place at one time.

                              Suddenly a universe that had seemed complex, cluttered,
                              unpredictable, richly crowded, mysterious, and messy, began to look
                              neat and tidy. Every phenomenon from the atom inside a human cell to
                              the coldest star in the distant night sky could be understood as matter
                              in motion, each particle activating the next, forcing it to move in an
                              endless dance of existence. For the atheist this view provided an
                              explanation of life in which, as Laplace later put it, the hypothesis of
                              God was unnecessary. For the religious, however, it still left room for
                              God, since He could be regarded as the Prime Mover who used the
                              cue stick to set the billiard balls in motion, then perhaps retired from
                              the game.

                              This metaphor for reality came like a shot of intellectual adrenaline into
                              the emerging indust-real culture. One of the radical philosophers who
                              helped set the climate of the French Revolution, the Baron d'Holbach,
                              exulted, "The universe, that vast assemblage of everything that exists,
                              presents only matter and motion: the whole offers to our contemplation
                              nothing but an immense, an uninterrupted succession of causes and
                              effects."

                              It is all there—all implied in that one short, triumphant statement: the
                              universe is an assembled reality, made of discrete parts put together
                              into an "assemblage." Matter can only be understood hi terms of
                              motion—i.e., movement through space. Events occur in a [linear]
                              succession, a parade of events moving down the line of time. Human
                              passions like hatred, selfishness, or love, d'Holbach went on, could be
                              compared to physical forces like repulsion, inertia, or traction, and a
                              wise political state could manipulate them for the public good just as
                              science could manipulate the physical world for the common good.

                              It is precisely from this indust-real image of the universe, from the
                              assumptions buried within it, that some of the most potent of our
                              personal, social, and political behavior patterns have come. Buried
                              within them was the implication that not only the cosmos and nature
                              but society and people behaved according to certain fixed and
                              predictable laws. Indeed, the greatest thinkers of the Second Wave
                              were precisely those who most logically and forcefully argued the
                              lawfulness of the universe.

                              Newton seemed to have discovered the laws that pro-]]></page><page Index="94"><![CDATA[114 THE THIRD WAVE

                              grammed the heavens. Darwin had identified laws that programmed
                              social evolution. And Freud supposedly laid bare the laws that
                              programmed the psyche. Others—scientists, engineers, social
                              scientists, psychologists—pressed the search for still more, or
                              different, laws.

                              Second Wave civilization now had at its command a theory of causality
                              that seemed miraculous in its power and wide applicability. Much that
                              hitherto had seemed complex could be reduced to simple explanatory
                              formulae. Nor were these laws or rules to be accepted simply because
                              Newton or Marx or someone laid them down. They were subject to
                              experiment and empirical test. They could be validated. Using them,
                              we could build bridges, send radio waves into the sky, predict and
                              retrodict biological change; we could manipulate the economy,
                              organize political movements or machines, and even—so they
                              claimed—foresee and shape the behavior of the ultimate individual.

                              All that was needed was to find the critical variable to explain any
                              phenomenon. We could accomplish anything if only we could find the
                              appropriate "billiard ball' and hit it from the best angle.

                              This new causality, combined with the new images of time, space, and
                              matter, liberated much of the human race from the tyranny of ancient
                              mumbo jumbo. It made possible triumphant achievements in science
                              and technology, miracles of conceptualization and practical
                              accomplishment. It challenged authoritarianism and liberated the mind
                              from millennia of imprisonment.

                              But indust-reality also created its own new prison, an industrial
                              mentality that derogated or ignored what it could not quantify, that
                              frequently praised critical rigor and punished imagination, that reduced
                              people to oversimplified protoplasmic units, that ultimately sought an
                              engineering solution for any problem.

                              Nor was indust-reality as morally neutral as it pretended to be. It was,
                              as we have seen, the militant super-ideology of Second Wave
                              civilization, the self-justifying source from which all the characteristic
                              left-wing and right-wing ideologies of the industrial age sprang. Like
                              any culture, Second Wave civilization produced distorting filters
                              through which its people came to see themselves and the universe.
                              This package of ideas, images, assumptions—and the analogies that
                              flowed from them—formed the most powerful cultural system in history.

                              THE FLASH FLOOD

                              One mystery remains. Industrialism was a flash flood in history—a brief
                              three centuries lost in the immensity of time. What caused the
                              industrial revolution? What sent the Second Wave surging across the
                              planet?

                              Many streams of change flowed together to form a great confluence.
                              The discovery of the New World sent a pulse of energy into Europe's
                              culture and economy on the eve of the industrial revolution. Population
                              growth encouraged a movement into the towns. The exhaustion of
                              Britain's timber forests prompted the use of coal. In turn, this forced the
                              mine shafts deeper and deeper until the old horse-driven pumps could
                              no longer clear them of water. The steam engine was perfected to
                              solve this problem, leading to a fantastic array of new technological
                              opportunities. The gradual dissemination of indust-real ideas
                              challenged church and political authority. The spread of literacy, the
                              improvement of roads and transport—all these converged in time,
                              forcing open the floodgates of change.

                              Any search for The cause of the industrial revolution is doomed. For
                              there was no single or dominant cause. Technology, by itself, is not the
                              driving force of history. Nor, by themselves, are ideas or values. Nor is
                              the class struggle. Nor is history merely a record of ecological shifts,
                              demographic trends or communications inventions. Economics alone
                              cannot explain this or any other historical event. There is no
                              "independent variable" upon which all other variables depend. There
                              are only interrelated variables, boundless in complexity. Faced with
                              this maze of causal influences, unable even to 116

                              trace all their interactions, the most we can do is focus on those that
                              seem most revealing for our purposes and recognize the distortion
                              implicit in that choice. In this spirit, it is clear that of all the many forces
                              that flowed together to form Second Wave civilization, few had more
                              traceable consequences than the widening split between producer and
                              consumer, and the growth of that fantastic exchange network we now
                              call the market, whether capitalist or socialist in form.

                              The greater the divorce of producer from consumer — in time, in

                              metaphors and hidden assumptions, came to dominate social reality.

                              As we have seen, this invisible wedge produced the entire modern
                              money system with its central banking institutions, its stock exchanges,
                              its world trade, its bureaucratic planners, its quantitative and
                              calculating spirit, its contractual ethic, its materialist bias, its narrow
                              measurement of success, its rigid reward systems, and its powerful
                              accounting apparatus, whose cultural significance we routinely
                              underestimate. From this divorce of producer from consumer came
                              many of the pressures toward standardization, specialization,
                              synchronization, and centralization. From it came differences in sexual
                              role and temperament. However we evaluate the many other forces
                              that launched the Second Wave, this splitting of the ancient atom of
                              production and/or consumption must surely rank high among them.
                              The shock waves of that fission are still apparent today.

                              Second Wave civilization did not merely alter technology, nature, and
                              culture. IL altered personality, helping to produce a new social
                              character. OF course, women and children shaped Second Wave
                              civilization and were shaped by it. But because men were drawn more
                              directly into the market matrix and the new modes of work, they took
                              on more pronounced industrial characteristics than women, and
                              women readers will perhaps forgive the use of the term Industrial Man
                              to sum up these new characteristics.

                              Industrial Man was different from all his forerunners. He was the
                              master of "energy slaves" that amplified his puny

                              power enormously. He spent much of his life in a factory-style
                              environment, in touch with machines and organizations that dwarfed
                              the individual. He learned, almost from infancy, that survival depended
                              as never before on money. He typi-cally grew up in a nuclear Family,
                              and went to a factory-style

                              worked for a large corporation or public agency, belonged to unions,
                              churches, and other organizations—to each of which he parceled out a
                              piece of his divided self. He identified less and less with his village or
                              city than with his nation. He saw himself standing in opposition to
                              nature—exploiting it daily in his work. Yet he paradoxically rushed to
                              visit it on weekends. (Indeed, the more he savaged nature, the more
                              he romanticized and revered it with words.) He learned to see himself
                              as part of vast, interdependent economic, social, and political systems
                              whose edges faded into complexities beyond his understanding.

                              Faced with this reality, he rebelled without success. He fought to make
                              a living. He learned to play the games required by society, fitted into
                              his assigned roles, often hating them and feeling himself a victim of the
                              very system that improved his standard of living. He sensed straight-

                              himself, were merely part of a larger cosmic machine whose motions
                              were regular and relentless.

                              Industrial Man occupied an environment that would have been in many
                              respects unrecognizable to his ancestors. Even the most elementary
                              sensory signals were different.

                              The Second Wave changed the soundscape, substituting the factory
                              whistle for the rooster, the screech of tires for the chirruping of crickets.
                              It lit up the night, extending the hours of awareness. It brought visual
                              images no eye had ever seen before—the earth photographed from
                              the sky, or surrealist montages in the local cinema, or biological forms
                              revealed for the first time by high-powered microscopes. The odor of
                              night soil gave way to the smell of gasoline and the stench of phenols.
                              The tastes of meat and vegetables were altered. The entire perceptual
                              landscape was transformed.

                              So too was the human body, which for the first time grew to what we
                              now regard as its full normal height; successive generations grew taller
                              than their parents. Attitudes toward the body changed as well. Norbert
                              Elias tell us in The Civilizing Process that, whereas up to the sixteenth
                              century in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, "the sight of total
                              nakedness was an everyday rule,"nakedness came to be regarded as
                              shameful when the Second Wave spread. Bedroom behavior changed
                              as special nightclothes came into use. Eating became

                              implements. From a culture that took active pleasure in the sight of a
                              dead animal on the table came a shift toward one in which "reminders
                              that the meat dish has something to do with the killing of an animal are
                              to be avoided to the utmost.'*.

                              Marriage became more than an economic convenience. War was
                              amplified and put on the assembly line. Changes in the parent-child
                              relationship, in opportunities for upward mobility, in every aspect of
                              human relations brought for millions a radically changed sense of self.

                              Faced by so many changes, psychological as well as economic,
                              political as well as social, the brain boggles at evaluation. By what
                              criteria do we judge an entire civilization? By the standard of living it
                              provided for the masses who lived in it? By its influence on those who
                              lived outside its perimeter? By its impact on the biosphere? By the
                              excellence of its arts? By the lengthened life span of its people? By its
                              scientific achievements? By the freedom of the individual?

                              Within its borders, despite massive economic depressions and a

                              supposedly lovely rural communities were, in fact, cesspools of
                              malnutrition, disease, poverty, homelessness, and tyranny, with people
                              helpless against hunger, cold, and the whips of their landlords and
                              masters.

                              Much has been made of the hideous slums that sprang up in or around
                              the major cities, of the adulterated food, disease-bearing water
                              supplies, the poorhouses and daily squalor. Yet, terrible as these
                              conditions unquestionably were, they surely represented a vast

                              behind. The British author John Vaizey has noted, "The picture of
                              bucolic yeoman England was an exaggerated one," and for significant
                              numbers the move to the urban slum provided "in fact a dramatic rise

                              In terms of health, one need only read The Age of Agony by Guy
                              Williams or Death, Disease and Famine in Pre-lndus-trial England by
                              L. A. Clarkson to counteract those who glorify First Wave civilization at
                              the expense of Second. Christina Larner, in a review of these books,
                              states, "The work of social historians and demographers has
                              highlighted the overwhelming presence of disease, pain and death in
                              the open countryside as well as the noxious towns. Life expectancy
                              was low: about 40 years in the 16th century, reduced to the mid-thirties
                              in the epidemic-ridden 17th century, and rising to the early forties in the
                              18th. ... It was rare for married couples to have long years together ...
                              all children were at hazard." However justly we may criticize today's
                              crisis-ridden, misdirected health systems, it is worth recalling that
                              before the industrial revolution official medicine was deadly,
                              emphasizing bloodletting and surgery without anesthesia.

                              The major causes of death were plague, typhus, influenza, dysentery,
                              smallpox, and tuberculosis. "It is often observed by the sages," Larner
                              writes dryly, "that we have merely replaced these by a different set of

                              industrialism, for all its narrow-minded materialism, any more mentally
                              stultifying than the feudal societies that preceded it? Was the
                              mechanistic mentality, or indust-reality, any less open to new ideas,
                              even heresies, than the medieval church or the monarchies of the
                              past? For all we detest our giant bureaucracies, are they more rigid
                              than the Chinese bureaucracies of centuries ago, or ancient Egyptian
                              hierarchies? And as for art, are the novels and poems and paintings of
                              the past three hundred years in the West any less alive, profound,
                              revealing, or complex than the works of earlier periods or different

                              ogy, and its incessant need for expansion, it wreaked more
                              environmental havoc than any preceding age. I have read the
                              accounts'of horse dung in the streets of preindustrial cities (usually
                              offered as reassuring evidence that pollution is nothing new). I am
                              aware that sewage filled the streets of ancient towns. Nevertheless,
                              industrial society raised the problems of ecological pollution and
                              resource use to a radically new level, making the present and past
                              incommensurable.

                              Never before did any civilization create the means for literally
                              destroying not a city but a planet. Never did whole oceans face
                              toxification, whole species vanish overnight from the earth as a result
                              of human greed or inadvertence; never did mines scar the earth's
                              surface so savagely; never did hair-spray aerosols deplete the ozone
                              layer, or thermopollu-tion threaten the planetary climate.

                              Similar but even more complex is the question of imperial-ism. The
                              enslavement of Indians to dig the mines of South America, the
                              introduction of plantation farming in large parts of Africa and Asia, the
                              deliberate distortion of colonial economies to suit the needs of the
                              industrial nations, all left agony, hunger, disease, and deculturation in
                              their wake. The racism exuded by Second Wave civilization, the forced
                              integration of small-scale self-sufficient economies into the world trade
                              system, left festering wounds that have not yet begun to heal.

                              However, once again it would be a mistake to glamorize these early
                              subsistence economies. It is questionable whether the populations of
                              even the non-industrial regions of the earth are worse off today than
                              they were three hundred years ago. In terms of life span, food intake,
                              infant mortality, literacy, as^ well as human dignity, hundreds of
                              millions of human beings today, from the Sahel to Central America,
                              suffer indescribable miseries. Yet it would be a disservice to them to
                              invent a fake, romantic past in our rush to judge the present. The way
                              into the future is not through reversion to an even more miserable past.

                              Just as there is no single cause that produced Second Wave
                              civilization, so there can be no single evaluation. I have tried to present
                              a picture of Second Wave civilization with its faults included. If I appear
                              on the one hand to condemn it and on the other to approve, it is
                              because simple judgments are misleading. I detest the way

                              incinerate Hiroshima. I am ashamed of its cultural arrogance and its
                              depredations against the rest of the world. I am sickened by the waste
                              of human energy, imagination, and spirit in our ghettos and barrios.

                              Yet unreasoning hatred for one's own time and people is hardly the
                              best basis for creation of the future. Was industrialism an air-
                              conditioned nightmare, a wasteland, an unmitigated horror? Was it a
                              world of "single vision" as claimed by the enemies of science and
                              technology? No doubt. But it was far more than that as well. It was, like
                              life itself, a bittersweet instant in eternity.

                              However one chooses to evaluate the fading present, it is vital to
                              understand that the industrial game is over, its energies spent, the
                              force of the Second Wave diminshing everywhere as the next wave of
                              change begins. Two changes, by themselves, make the "normal"
                              continuation of inddustrial civ-ilization no longer possible.

                              First, we've reached a turning point in the "war against nature." The
                              biosphere will simply no longer tolerate the in-dustrial assault. Second,
                              we can no longer rely indefinitelv on nonrenewable energy, until now
                              the main subsidy of industrial development.

                              These facts do not mean the end of technological society, or the end of
                              energy. But they do mean that all future technological advance will be
                              shaped by new environmental constraints. They also mean that until
                              new sources are substituted, the industrial nations will suffer recurrent,
                              possibly violent withdrawal symptoms, with the struggle to substitute
                              new forms of energy itself accelerating social and political
                              transformation.

                              One thing is apparent: we are at the end—at least for some decades—
                              of cheap energy. Second Wave civilization has lost one of its two most
                              basic subsidies.

                              Simultaneously that other hidden subsidy is being withdrawn: cheap
                              raw materials. Faced with the end of colonialism and neoimperialism,
                              the high technology nations will either turn inward for new substitutes
                              and resources, buying from one another and gradually lessening their
                              economic ties with the non-industrial states, or they will continue
                              buying from the non-industrial countries but under totally new terms of
                              trade. In either case costs will rise substantially, and the entire
                              resource base of the civilization will be transformed along with its
                              energy base.

                              These external pressures on industrial society are matched by
                              disintegrative pressures inside the system. Whether we focus on the

                              (which is worse today than in some banana republics), or the

                              is the same: people and systems strained to the ultimate breaking
                              point.

                              Second Wave systems are in crisis. Thus we find crisis hi the welfare
                              systems. Crisis in the postal systems. Crisis in the school systems.
                              Crisis in the health-delivery systems. Crisis in the urban systems.
                              Crisis in the international financial system. The nation-state itself is in
                              crisis. The Second Wave value system is in crisis.

                              Even the role system that held industrial civilization together is in crisis.
                              This we see most dramatically in the struggle to redefine sex roles. In
                              the women's movement, in the demands for the legalization of
                              homosexuality, in the spread of unisex fashions, we see a continual
                              blurring of the traditional expectations for the sexes. Occupational role-
                              lines are blurring, too. Nurses and patients alike are redefining their
                              roles vis-a-vis doctors. Police and teachers are breaking out of their
                              assigned roles and taking illegal strike action. Paralegals are redefining
                              the role of attorney. Workers, more and more, are demanding
                              participation, infringing on tradi tional management roles. And this
                              society-wide crack-up of the role structure upon which industrialism
                              depended is far more revolutionary in its implications than all the
                              overtly political protests and marches by which headline writers
                              measure change.

                              Finally, this convergence of pressures—the loss of key subsidies, the
                              malfunctioning of the main life-support systems of the society, the
                              break-up of the role structure—all produce crisis in that most elemental
                              and fragile of structures: the personality. The collapse of Second Wave
                              civilization has,

                              created an epidpmic of personality crisis.

                              Today we see millions desperately searching for their own shadows,
                              devouring movies, plays, novels, and self-help books, no matter how
                              obscure, that promise to help them lo cate their missing identities.In
                              the United States, as we shall see, the manifestations of the
                              personality crisis are bizarre.

                              Its victims hurl themselves into group therapy, mysticism, or sexual
                              games. They itch for change but are terrified by it. They urgently wish
                              to leave their present existences and leap,

                              somehow, to a new life—to become what they are not. They, want to
                              change jobs, spouses, roles, and responsibilities.

                              Even supposedly mature and complacent American businessmen are
                              not exempt from this disaffection with the present. The American
                              Management Association finds in a recent survey that fully 40 percent
                              of middle managers are unhappy in their jobs, and over a third dream
                              of an alternative career in which they feel they would be happier. Some

                              chase themselves faster and faster around a shrinking circle and
                              eventually crack under the pressure.

                              Rooting about in themselves for the source of their discomfort, they
                              undergo agonies of unnecessary guilt. They seem blankly unaware
                              that what they are feeling inside themselves is the subjective reflection
                              of a much larger objective crisis: they are acting out an unwitting
                              drama within a drama.

                              One can persist in viewing each of these various crises as an isolated
                              event. We can ignore the connections between the energy crisis and
                              the personality crisis, between new technologies and new sexual roles,
                              and other such hidden interrelationships. But we do so at our peril. For
                              what is happening is larger than any of these. Once we think in terms
                              of successive waves of interrelated change, of the collision of these
                              waves, we grasp the essential fact of our generation—that
                              industrialism is dying away—and we can begin searching among signs
                              of change for what is truly new, what is no longer industrial. We can
                              identify the Third Wave.

                              It is this Third Wave of change that will frame the rest of our lives. If we
                              are to smooth the transition between the old dying civilization and the
                              new one that is taking form, if we are to maintain a sense of self and
                              the ability to manage our own lives through the intensifying crises that
                              lie ahead, we must be able to recognize—and create—Third Wave
                              innovations.

                              For if we look closely around us we find, crisscrossing the
                              manifestations of failure and collapse, early signs of growth and new
                              potential.

                              If we listen closely we can hear the Third Wave already thundering on
                              not so distant shores.

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              THE NEW SYNTHESIS

                              In January 1950, just as the second half of the twentieth century
                              opened, a gangling twenty-two-year-old with a newly minted university
                              diploma took a long bus ride through the night into what he regarded
                              as the central reality of our time. With his girl friend at his side and a
                              pasteboard suitcase filled with books under the seat, he watched a
                              gunmetal dawn come up as the factories of the American Midwest slid
                              endlessly past the rain-swept window.

                              America was the heartland of the world. The region ringing the Great
                              Lakes was the industrial heartland of America. And the factory was the
                              throbbing core of this heart of hearts: steel mills, aluminum foundries,
                              tool and die shops, oil refineries, auto plants, mile after mile of dingy
                              buildings vibrating with huge machines for stamping, punching, drilling,
                              bending, welding, forging, and casting metal. The factory was the
                              symbol of the entire industrial era and, to a boy raised in a semi-

                              I spent five years in those factories, not as a clerk or personnel
                              assistant but as an assembly hand, a millwright, a welder, a forklift
                              driver, a punch press operator—stamping out fans, fixing machines in
                              a foundry, building giant dust-control machines for African mines,
                              finishing the metal on light trucks as they sped clattering and
                              screeching past on the assembly line. I learned firsthand how factory
                              workers struggled to earn a living in the industrial age.

                              I swallowed the dust, the sweat and smoke of the foundry. My ears
                              were split by the hiss of steam, the clank of chains, the roar of pug
                              mills. I felt the heat as the white-hot steel poured. Acetylene sparks left
                              burn marks on my legs. I turned out thousands of pieces a shift on a
                              press, repeating identical movements until my mind and muscles
                              shrieked. I watched the managers who kept the workers in their place,
                              white-shirted men themselves endlessly pursued and harried by
                              higher-ups. I helped lift a sixty-five-year-old woman out of the bloody
                              machine that had just torn four fingers off her hand, and I still hear her
                              cries—"Jesus and Mary, I won't be able to work againl'*

                              The factory. Long live the factory! Today, even as new factories are
                              being built, the civilization that made the factory into a cathedral is
                              dying. And somewhere, right now, other young men and women are
                              driving through the night into the heart of the emergent Third Wave
                              civilizaion. Our task from here on will be to join, as it were, their quest
                              for tomorrow.

                              If we could pursue them to their destinations, where would we arrive?
                              In the launching stations that hurl flaming vehicles and fragments of
                              human consciousness into outer space? In oceanographic
                              laboratories? In communal families? In teams working on artificial
                              intelligence? In passionate religious sects? Are they living in voluntary
                              simplicity? Are they climbing the corporate ladder? Are they running
                              guns to terrorists? Where is the future being forged?

                              If we ourselves were planning a similar expedition into the future, how
                              would we prepare our maps? It is easy to say the future begins in the
                              present. But which present? Our present is exploding with paradox.

                              Our children are supersophisticated about drugs, sex, or space shots;
                              some know far more about computers than their parents. Yet
                              educational test scores plummet. Divorce rates continue their climb—
                              but so do remarriage rates. Counter-feminists arise at the exact time
                              that women win rights even the counterfeminists endorse. Gays
                              demand their rights and come charging out of the closet—only to find

                              In politics, parties lose the allegiance of their members at the precise
                              moment when key issues—technology, for example—are becoming
                              more politicized than ever. Meanwhile, over vast reaches of the earth,
                              nationalist movements gain power—at the exact instant that the nation-
                              state comes under intensifying attack in the name of globalism or
                              planetary consciousness.

                              Faced with such contradictions, how might we see behind the trends
                              and counter-trends? No one, alas, has any magic answer to that
                              question. Despite all the computer printouts, cluster diagrams, and
                              mathematical models and matrices that futurist researchers use, our
                              attempts to peer into tomorrow—or even to make sense of today—
                              remain, as they must, more an art than a science.

                              Systematic, research can teach us much. But in the end we must
                              embrace—not dismiss—paradox and contradiction, hunch,
                              imagination, and daring (though tentative) synthesis.

                              In probing the future in the pages that follow, therefore, we must do
                              more than identifv_jmafor trends. Difficult as it may be, we must resist
                              the temptation to be seduced by straight lines. Most people—including
                              many futurists— conceive of tomorrow as a mere extension of today,
                              forgetting that trends, no matter how seemingly powerful, do not
                              merely continue in a linear fashion. They reach tipping points at which
                              they explode into new phenomena. They reverse direction. They stop
                              and start. Because something is happening now, or has been
                              happening for three hundred years, is no guarantee that it will
                              continue. We shall, in the pages ahead, watch for precisely those
                              contradictions, conflicts, turnabouts, and breakpoints that make the
                              future a continuing surprise.

                              More important, we will search out the hidden connections among
                              events that on the surface seem unrelated. It does little good to
                              forecast the future of semiconductors or energy, or the future of the
                              family (even one's own family), if the forecast springs from the premise
                              that everything else will remain unchanged. For nothing will remain
                              unchanged. The future is-fluid, not frozen. It is constructed by our
                              shifting and changing daily decisions, and each event influences all
                              others.

                              Second Wave civilization placed an extremely heavy emphasis on our
                              ability to dismantle problems into their components; it rewarded us less

                              pieces back together again. Most people are culturally more skilled as
                              analysts than synthesists. This is one reason why our images of the
                              future (and of ourselves in that future) are so fragmentary,
                              haphazard—and wrong. Our job here will be to think like generalists,
                              not specialists.

                              Today I believe we stand on the edge of a new age of synthesis. In all
                              intellectual fields, from the hard sciences to sociology, psychology, and
                              economics—especially economics—we are likely to see a return to
                              large-scale thinking, to general theory, to the putting of the pieces back
                              together again. For it is beginning to dawn on us that our obsessive
                              emphasis on quantified detail without context, on progressively finer
                              and finer measurement of smaller and smaller problems, leaves us
                              knowing more and more about less and less.

                              Our approach in what follows, therefore, will be to look forJhose
                              streams of change that are shaking our Iives1 to^re^ veal the

                              change run together to form even larger, deeper, swifter rivers of
                              change that, in turn, flow into something still larger: the Third Wave.

                              Like that young man who set out in mid-century to find the heart of the
                              present, we now begin our search for the future. This search may be
                              the most important of our lives.

                              COMMANDING

                              On August 8, 1960, a West Virginia-born chemical engineer named
                              Monroe Rathbone, sitting in his office high over Rockefeller Plaza in
                              Manhattan, made a decision that future historians might some day
                              choose to symbolize the end of the Second Wave era.

                              Few paid any attention that day when Rathbone, chief executive of the
                              giant Exxon Corporation, took steps to cut back on the taxes Exxon
                              paid to the oil-producing countries. His decision, though ignored by the
                              Western press, struck like a thunderbolt at the governments of these
                              countries, since virtually all their revenues derived from oil company
                              payments.

                              Within a few days the other major oil companies had followed Exxon's
                              lead. And one month later, on September 9, in the fabled city of
                              Baghdad, delegates of the hardest-hit countries met in emergency
                              council. Backed to the wall, they formed themselves into a committee
                              of oil-exporting governments. For fully thirteen years the activities of
                              this committee, and even its name, were ignored outside the pages of
                              a few petroleum industry journals. Until 1973, that is, when the Yom
                              Kippur War broke out and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
                              Countries suddenly stepped out of the shadows. Choking off the
                              world's supply of crude oil, it sent the entire Second Wave economy
                              into a shuddering down-spin.]]></page><page Index="106"><![CDATA[What OPEC did, apart from quadrupling its oil revenues, was to

                              THE SUN AND BEYOND

                              In the earsplitting clamor over the energy crisis that has since followed,
                              so many plans, proposals, arguments, and counterarguments have
                              been hurled at us that it is difficult to make sensible choices.
                              Governments are just as confused as the proverbial man in the street.

                              One way to cut through the murk is to look beyond the individual
                              technologies and policies to the principles underlying them. Once we
                              do, we find that certain proposals are designed to maintain or extend
                              the Second Wave energy base as we have known it, while others rest
                              on new principles. The result is a radical clarification of the entire
                              energy issue.

                              The Second Wave energy base, we saw earlier, was premised on non-
                              renewability; it drew from highly concentrated, exhaustible deposits; it
                              relied on expensive, heavily centralized technologies; and it was
                              nondiversified, resting on a relatively few sources and methods. These
                              were the main features of the energy base in all Second Wave nations
                              throughout the industrial era.

                              Bearing these in mind, if we now look at the various plans and
                              proposals generated by the oil crisis we can quickly tell which ones are
                              mere extensions of the old and which are forerunners of something
                              fundamentally new. And the basic question becomes not whether oil
                              should sell at forty dollars per barrel or whether a nuclear reactor
                              should rise at Sea-brook or Grohnde. The Tar|ger^|pstinn is whether
                              apy^ energy base designed for industrial society and premised on
                              these Second Wave principles can survive. Once asked in frSTtoTfiT.
                              the answer is inescapable.

                              Through the past half-century, fully two thirds of the entire world's
                              energy supply has come from oil and gas. Most observers today, from
                              the most fanatic conservationists to the deposed Shah of Iran, from
                              solar freaks and Saudi sheikhs to the button-down, briefcase-carrying
                              experts of many governments, agree that this dependency on fossil
                              fuel cannot continue indefinitely, no matter how many new oil fields are
                              discovered.

                              Statistics vary. Disputes rage over how long the world has before the
                              ultimate crunch. The forecasting complexities are enormous and many
                              past predictions now look silly. Yet one thing is clear: no one is
                              pumping gas and oil back into the earth to replenish the supply.

                              gluts, and deeper shortages, the oil epoch is ead=. jigg. Iranians know
                              this. Kuwaitis and Nigerians and Vene-IzueTans know it. Saudi
                              Arabians know it—which is why they are racing to build an economy
                              based on something other than oil revenues. Petroleum companies
                              know it—which is why they are scrambling to diversify out of oil. (One
                              president of a petroleum company told me at a dinner in Tokyo not
                              long ago that, in his opinion, the oil giants would become industrial
                              dinosaurs, as the railroads have. His time frame for this was
                              breathtakingly short—years, not decades.)

                              However, the debate over physical depletion is almost beside the
                              point. For in today's world it is price, not physical supply, that has the
                              most immediate and significant impact. And here, if anything, the facts
                              point even more strongly to the same conclusion.

                              In a matter of decades energy may once more become abundant and
                              cheap as a result of startling technological breakthroughs or economic
                              swings. But whatever happens, the relative price of oil is likely to
                              continue its climb as we are forced to plumb deeper and deeper
                              depths, to explore more remote regions, and to compete among more
                              buyers. OPEC aside, an historic turn has taken place over the past five
                              years: despite massive new discoveries like those in Mexico, despite
                              skyrocketing prices, the actual amount of confirmed, commercially
                              recoverable reserves of crude oil has shrunk, not grown—reversing a
                              trend that had lasted for decades. Further evidence, if needed, that the
                              petroholic era is screeching to a halt.

                              Meanwhile, coal, which has supplied most of the remaining third of the
                              world energy total, is in ample supply, though it, too, is ultimately
                              depletable. Any massive expansion of coal usage, however, entails the
                              spread of dirty air, a possible hazard to the world's climate (through an
                              increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere), and a ravaging of the
                              earth as well. Even if all these were accepted as necessary risks over
                              the decades to come, coal cannot fit into the tank of an automobile nor
                              carry out many other tasks now performed by oil or gas. Plants to
                              gasify or liquefy coal require staggering amounts of capital and water
                              (much of it needed for agriculture) and are so ultimately inefficient and
                              costly that they, too, must be seen as no more than expensive,
                              diversionary, and highly temporary expedients. Nuclear technology
                              presents even more formidable prob-

                              lems at its present stage of development. Conventional reactors rely
                              on uranium, yet another exhaustible fuel, and carry safety risks that are
                              extremely costly to overcome—if, indeed, they ever can be. No one
                              has convincingly solved the problems of nuclear waste disposal, and
                              nuclear costs are so high that until now government subsidies have
                              been essential to make atomic power remotely competitive with other
                              sources.]]></page><page Index="108"><![CDATA[Fast breeder reactors are in a class by themselves. But while often
                              presented to the uninformed public as perpetual motion machines
                              because the plutonium they spew out can be used as a fuel, they, too,
                              remain ultimately dependent upon the world's small and non-
                              renewable supply of uranium. They are not only highly centralized,
                              incredibly costly, volatile, and dangerous, they also escalate the risks
                              of nuclear war and terrorist capture of nuclear materials.

                              None of this means that we are going to be thrown back into the
                              middle ages, or that further economic advance is impossible. But it
                              surely means that we have reached the end of one line of development
                              and must now start another. It means that the Second Wave energy
                              base is unsustainable.

                              Indeed, there is yet another, even more fundamental reason why the
                              world must and will shift to a radically new energy base. For any
                              energy base, whether in a village or an industrial economy, must be
                              suited to the society's level of technology, the nature of production, the
                              distribution of markets and population, and many other factors.

                              The rise of the Second Wave energy base was associated with
                              society's advance to a whole new stage of technological development.
                              And while fossil fuels certainly accelerated technological growth, the
                              exact reverse was also true. The invention of energy-thirsty, brute
                              technology during the industrial era spurred the ever-more-rapid
                              exploitation of those very fossil fuels. The development of the auto
                              industry, for example, caused so radical an expansion of the oil
                              business that at one time it was essentially a dependency of Detroit. In
                              the words of Donald E. Carr, formerly an oil company research
                              director, and author of Energy and the Earth Machine, the petroleum
                              industry became "a slave to one form of internal combustion engine."

                              Today we are once more at the edge of an historic technological leap,
                              and the new system of production now emerging will require a radical
                              restructuring of the entire energy business—even if OPEC were to fold
                              its tent and quietly steal away.

                              THE COMMANDING HEIGHTS

                              For the great overlooked fact is that the energy problem is not just one
                              of quantity; it is one of structure as well. We not only need a certain
                              amount of energy, but energy delivered in many more varied forms, in
                              different (and changing) loca-tions, at different times of the day, night,
                              and year, and for undreamed of purposes.

                              This, not simply OPEC's pricing decisions, explains why the world must
                              search for alternatives to the old energy system. That search has been
                              accelerated, and we are now applying vast new resources of money
                              and imagination to the problem. As a result we are taking a close look
                              at many startling possibilities. While the shift from one energy base to
                              the next will no doubt be darkened by economic and other upheavals,
                              there is another, more positive aspect to it. For never in history have so
                              many people plunged with such fervor into a search for energy — and
                              never have we had so many novel and exciting potentials before us.]]></page><page Index="109"><![CDATA[It is clearly impossible to know at this stage which combination of
                              technologies will prove most useful for what tasks, but the array of
                              tools and fuels available to us will surely be staggering, with more and
                              more exotic possibilities becoming commercially plausible as oil prices
                              climb.

                              These possibilities range from photovoltaic-cells that convert sunlight
                              into electricity (a technology now being explored by Texas Instruments,
                              Solarex, Energy Conversion Devices, and many other companies), to a
                              Soviet plan for placing windmill-carrying balloons in the tropopause to
                              beam electricity down to earth through cables. New York City has
                              contracted with a private firm to burn garbage as fuel and the
                              Philippine Islands are building plants to produce electricity from
                              coconut waste. Italy, Iceland, and New Zealand are already generating
                              electricity from geothermal sources, tapping the heat of the earth itself,
                              while a five-hundred-ton floating platform off Honshu island in Japan is
                              generating electricity fron wave power. Solar heating units are
                              sprouting from rooftops around the world, and the Southern California
                              Edison Company is constructing a "power-tower" which will capture
                              solar energy through computer-controlled mirrors, fo-

                              cus it on a tower containing a steam boiler, and generate electricity for
                              its regular customers. In Stuttgart, Germany, a hydrogen-powered bus
                              built by Daimler-Benz has cruised I In-city streets, while engineers at
                              Lockheed-Calif orn in are wmk ing on a hydrogen-powered aircraft. So
                              many new avenues

                              are being explored, they are impossible to catalog in a short space.

                              When we combine new energy-generating technologies with new ways
                              to store and transmit energy, the possibilities become even more far-
                              reaching. General Motors has announced a new, more efficient
                              automobile battery for use in electric cars. NASA researchers have
                              come up with "Redox"—a storage system they believe can be
                              produced for one third the cost of conventional lead acid batteries.
                              With a longer time horizon we are exploring super-conductivity and
                              even—beyond the fringes of "respectable" science—Tesla waves as
                              ways of beaming energy with minimal loss.

                              While most of these technologies are still in their early stages of
                              development and many will no doubt prove zanily impractical, others
                              are clearly on the edge of commercial application or will be within a
                              decade or two. Most important is the neglected fact that big
                              breakthroughs often come not from a single isolated technology but
                              from imaginative juxta-positions or combinations of several. Thus we
                              may see solar photovoltaics used to produce electricity which will, in
                              turn, be used to release hydrogen from water so it can be used in cars.
                              Today we are still at the pre-takeoff stage. Once we begin to combine
                              these many new technologies, the number of more potent options will
                              rise exponentially, and we will dramatically accelerate the construction
                              of a Third Wave energy base.

                              This new base will have characteristics sharply different from those of
                              the Second Wave period. For much of its supply will come from
                              renewable, rather than exhaustible sources. Instead of being
                              dependent upon highly concentrated fuels, it will draw on a, variety of]]></page><page Index="110"><![CDATA[widely dispersed sources. Instead of depending so heavily on tightly
                              centralized tech-nologies, it will combine both centralized and
                              decentralized energy production. And instead of being dangerously
                              over-reliant on a handful of methods or sources, it will be radically
                              diversified in its form. This very diversity will make for less waste by
                              allowing us to match the types and quality of energy produced to the
                              increasingly varied needs.

                              In short, we can now see for the first time the outlines of an energy
                              base that runs on principles almost diametrically opposed to those of
                              the recent, three-hundred-year past. It is also clear that this Third
                              Wave energy base will not come into being without a bitter fight.

                              In this war of ideas and money that is already raging in all

                              THE COMMANDING HEIGHTS

                              137

                              the high-technology nations, it is possible to discern not two but three
                              antagonists. To begin with, there are those with vested interests in the
                              old, Second Wave energy base. They call for conventional energy
                              sources and technologies — coal, oil, gas, nuclear power, and their
                              various permutations. They fight, in effect, for an extension of the
                              Second Wave status quo. And because they are entrenched in the oil
                              companies, utilities, nuclear commissions, mining corporations, and
                              their associated trade unions, the Second Wave forces seem unas-
                              sailably in charge.

                              By contrast, those who favor the advance to a Third Wave energy
                              base—a combination of consumers, environmentalists, scientists, and
                              entrepreneurs in the leading-edge industries, along with their various
                              allies — seem scattered, underfinanced, and often politically inept.
                              Second Wave propagandists regularly picture them as naive,
                              unconcerned with dollar realities, and bedazzled by blue-sky
                              technology.

                              Worse yet, the Third Wave advocates are publicly confused with a
                              vocal fringe of what might best be termed First Wave forces — people
                              who call not for an advance to a new, more intelligent, sustainable, and
                              scientifically based energy system, but for a reversion to preindustrial
                              past. In extreme form,

                              their policies would eliminate most technology, restrict mobility, cause
                              cities to shrivel and die, and impose an ascetic culture in the name of
                              conservation.

                              By lumping these two groups together the Second Wave lobbyists,
                              public relations experts, and politicians deepen the public confusion
                              and keep the Third Wave forces on the defensive.

                              Nevertheless, supporters of neither First nor Second Wave policies

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              trial world for energy of its own, and for higher prices for its resources,
                              works against them.

                              In short, though nuclear reactors or coal gasification or liquefaction
                              plants and other such technologies may seem to be advanced or
                              futuristic and therefore progressive, they are, in fact, artifacts of a
                              Second Wave past caught in its own deadly contradictions. Some may
                              be necessary as temporary expedients, but they are essentially
                              regressive. Similarly, though the forces of the Second Wave may seem
                              powerful and their Third Wave critics feeble, it would be foolish to bet
                              too many chips on the past. Indeed, the issue is not whether the
                              Second Wave energy base will be overthrown, superseded by a new
                              one, but how soon. For the struggle over energy is inextricably
                              intertwined with another change of equal profundity: the overthrow of
                              Second Wave technology.

                              TOOLS OF TOMORROW

                              Coal, rail, textile, steel, auto, rubber, machine tool manufacture—these
                              were the classical industries of the Second Wave. Based on essentially
                              simple electromechanical principles, they used high energy inputs,
                              spat out enormous waste and pollution, and were characterized by
                              long production runs, low skill requirements, repetitive work,
                              standardized goods, and heavily centralized controls.

                              From the mid-1950's it became increasingly apparent that these
                              industries were backward and waning in the industrial nations. In the
                              United States, for example, while the labor force grew by 21 percent
                              between 1965 and 1974, textile employment rose by only 6 percent
                              and employment in iron and steel actually dropped 10 percent A similar
                              pattern was evident in Sweden, Czechoslovakia, Japan, and other
                              Second Wave nations.

                              As these old-fashioned industries began to be transferred to so-called
                              "developing" countries, where labor was cheaper and technology less
                              advanced, their social influence also began to die out and a set of
                              dynamic new industries shot up to take their place.

                              These new industries differed markedly from their predecessors in

                              nucleonics, ecology, and the space sciences. And they made it
                              possible for us to reach beyond the grosser features of time and
                              spacejwith which Second Wave industry concerned itself, to
                              manipulate, as Soviet physicist B. G. Kuznetsov has noted, "very small
                              spatial regions (say, of the radius of an atomic nucleus, i.e., 1(H3
                              centimeters) and temporal intervals of the order of Kh23 seconds."

                              It is from, these new sciences and our radically enhanced
                              manipulative" abilities, that the new industries arose — computers and
                              data processing, aerospace, sophisticated petrochemicals,
                              semiconductors, advanced communications, and scores of others.

                              In the United States, where this shift from Second Wave to Third Wave
                              technologies began earliest — sometime in the mid-1 950's — old
                              regions like the Merrimack Valley in New England sank into the status
                              of depressed areas while places like Route 128 outside Boston or
                              "Silicon Valley" in California zoomed into prominence, their suburban
                              homes filled with specialists in solid-state physics, systems
                              engineering, artificial intelligence, or polymer chemistry.

                              Moreover, one could track the transfer of jobs and affluence as they
                              followed the transfer of technology, so that the so-called "sun-belt"
                              states, fed by heaw defense contracts, built an advanced technological
                              base while the older industrial regions in the Northeast and around the
                              Great Lakes plunged into lassitude and near-bankruptcy. The long
                              running financial crisis of New York City was a clear reflection of this
                              technological upheaval. So, too, was the stagnation of Lorraine,
                              France's center of steelmaking. And so, at yet another level, was the
                              failure of British socialism. Thus, at the end of World War II the Labour
                              government spoke of seizing the "commanding heights" of industry and
                              did so. But the commanding heights it nationalized turned out to be
                              coal, rail, and steel — precisely those industries being by-passed by
                              the technological revolution: yesterday's commanding heights.

                              European Investment Bank to facilitate the move out of traditional
                              mass production industries.

                              accounts for more than $100 billion in sales per year and is expected
                              to hit $325 billion or even $400 billion by the late 1980's. This would
                              make it the world's fourth largest industry, after steel, auto, and
                              chemicals. The speed' with which computers have spread is so well
                              known it hardly needs elaboration. Costs have dropped so sharply and
                              capacity has risen so spectacularly that, according to Computer-world
                              magazine, "If the auto industry had done what the computer industry
                              has done in the last 30 years, a Rolls-Royce would cost $2.50 and get
                              2,000,000 miles to the gallon."

                              Today, cheap mini-computers are about to invade the American home.
                              By June 1979 some one hundred companies were already
                              manufacturing home computers. Giants like Texas Instruments were in
                              the field, and chains like Sears and Montgomery Ward were on the
                              edge of adding computers to their household wares. "Some day soon,"
                              chirruped a Dallas microcomputer retailer, "every home will have a
                              computer. It will be as standard as a toilet."

                              Linked to banks, stores, government offices, to neighbors' homes and
                              to the workplace, such computers are destined to reshape not only
                              business, from production to retailing, but the very nature of work and,
                              indeed, even the structure of the family.

                              Like the computer industry to which it is umbilically tied, the electronics
                              industry has also been exploding, and consumers have been deluged
                              with hand-held calculators, diode watches, and TV-screen games.
                              These, however, provide only the palest hint of what lies in store: tiny,
                              cheap climate and soil sensors in agriculture; infinitesimal medical

                              The advance toward Third Wave industries, moreover, will be radically
                              accelerated by the energy crisis, inasmuch as many of them carry us
                              toward processes and products that are miserly in their energy
                              requirements. Second Wave telephone systems, for example, required
                              virtual copper mines beneath the city streets—endless miles of snaking
                              cable, conduit, relays, and switches. We are now about to convert to
                              fiber optic systems that use hair-thin light-carrying fibers to convey
                              messages. The energy implications of this switchover are staggering: it
                              takes about one thousandth the energy to manufacture optical fiber
                              that it took to dig, smelt, and process an equivalent length of copper
                              wire. The same ton of coal required to produce 90 miles of copper wire
                              can turn out 80,000 miles of fiber!

                              The shift to solid-state physics in electronics moves in the same
                              direction, each step forward producing components that require
                              smaller and smaller inputs of energy. At IBM, the latest developments
                              in L.S.I. (Large Scale Integration) technology involve components that
                              are activated by as little as fifty microwatts.

                              This characteristic of the electronic revolution suggests that one of the
                              most powerful conservation strategies for energy-starved high-
                              technology economies may well be the rapid sub-stitution of low-

                              More generally, the journal Science is correct when it states that "the
                              country's economic activity may be substantially altered" by the
                              electronics explosion. "Indeed, it is probable that reality will outstrip
                              fiction in the rate of introduction of new and often unexpected
                              applications of electronics."

                              The electronics explosion, however, is only one step in the direction of
                              an entirely new techno-sphere.

                              Douglas offers to pharmaceutical companies "a space shuttle device
                              that will separate rare enzymes from human cells. Glass
                              manufacturers are looking at ways of making materials for lasers and
                              fiber optics in space. Space-produced single-crystal semiconductors
                              make earth-made models seem primitive. Urokinase, a blood clot dis-
                              solver needed for patients suffering from certain forms of blood
                              disease, now costs $2,500 per dose. According to Jesco von
                              Puttkamer, chief of space industrialization studies for NASA, it could be
                              manufactured in space for less than one fifth that amount.

                              More important are the totally new products that simply cannot be
                              made on earth at virtually any price. TRW, an aerospace and
                              electronics company, has identified four hundred different alloys that
                              we cannot manufacture on earth because of the pull of gravity. General
                              Electric, meanwhile, has begun the design of a space furnace.
                              Daimler-Benz and M.A.N. in West Germany are interested in the space
                              manufacture of ball bearings, and the European Space Agency and
                              individual companies like British Aircraft Corporation are also designing
                              equipment and products aimed at making space useful commercially.

                              companies are deadly serious in pursuing them." Equally serious, and
                              even more zealous, are the supporters of Dr. Gerard O'Neill's plan for
                              the creation of space cities. O'Neill, a Princeton physicist, has been
                              indefatigably educating the public about the possibilities of building
                              very large scale communities in space—platforms or islands with
                              populations in the thousands—and has won enthusiastic support from
                              NASA, the governor of California (whose state economy is heavily
                              space dependent) and, more surprisingly, from a band of vocal ex-
                              hippies led by Stewart Brand, creator of the Whole Earth Catalog.

                              O'Neill's idea is to build a city in space, bit by bit, out of materials
                              mined on the moon or elsewhere in space. A colleague, Dr. Brian
                              O'Leary, has been studying the possibilities of mining the Apollo and
                              Amor asteroids. Regular conferences at Princeton bring together

                              INTO THE DEPTHS

                              The push into the depths of the sea provides us with a mirror image of
                              the drive into outer space, and lays the basis for the third cluster of
                              industries likely to form a major part of the new techno-sphere. The
                              first historic wave of social change on earth came when our ancestors
                              ceased to rely on foraging and hunting, and began instead to
                              domesticate animals and cultivate the soil. We are now at precisely
                              this stage in our relationship to the seas.

                              In a hungry world,, the ocean can help break the back of the food
                              problem. Properly farmed and ranched, it offers us a virtually endless
                              supply of desperately needed protein. Present-day commercial fishing,
                              which is highly industrial-ized—Japanese and Soviet factory-ships

                              144 THE THIRD WAVE

                              results in ruthless overkill and threatens the total extinction of many
                              forms of marine life. By contrast, intelligent "aquacul-ture"—fish
                              farming and herding, along with plant harvesting—could make a major
                              dent in the global food crisis without damaging the fragile biosphere
                              upon which all our lives depend.

                              The rush to offshore oil drilling, meanwhile, has obscured the
                              possibility of "growing oil" in the sea. Dr. Lawrence Raymond at the
                              Battelle Memorial Institute has demonstrated that it is possible to
                              produce algae with a high oil content, and efforts are under way to
                              make the process economically effective.

                              The oceans also offer an overwhehning array of minerals, from copper,
                              zinc, and tin, to silver, gold, platinum and, even more important,
                              phosphate ores from which to produce fertilizer for land-based
                              agriculture. Mining companies are eyeing the hot waters of the Red
                              Sea which hold an estimated $3.4 billion worth of zinc, silver, copper,
                              lead, and gold. About 100 companies, including some of the world's
                              largest, are now preparing to mine potato-shaped manganese nodules
                              from the sea bed. (These nodules are a renewable resource, forming
                              at the rate of six to ten million tons per year in a single well-identified
                              belt just south of Hawaii.)

                              Today four truly international consortia are gearing up to start ocean
                              mining on a multibillion dollar scale hi the mid-19 80's. One such
                              consortium brings together twenty-three Japanese companies, a West
                              German group called AMR, and the U.S. subsidiary of Canada's
                              International Nickel. A second links Union Miniere, the Belgian
                              company, with United States Steel and the Sun Company. The third
                              venture unites Canada's Noranda interests with Mitsubishi of Japan,
                              Rio Tinto Zinc, and Consolidated Gold Fields of the United Kingdom.
                              The last consortium ties Lockheed to the Royal Dutch/Shell group.]]></page><page Index="117"><![CDATA[These efforts, says the Financial Times of London, are expected to
                              "revolutionise world mining activities for selected minerals."

                              In addition, Hoffmann-La Roche, the pharmaceutical company, has
                              been quietly scouring the seas for new drugs, such as antifungal
                              agents and pain-killers or diagnostic aids and drugs that stop bleeding.

                              As these technologies develop we are likely to witness the construction
                              of semi- or 'even wholly submerged "aquavil-lages" and floating
                              factories. The combination of zero real estate costs (at least at
                              present) plus cheap energy produced on

                              the spot from ocean sources (wind, thermal currents, or tides) can
                              make this kind of construction competitive with that on land.

                              The technical journal Marine Policy concludes that "Ocean floating
                              platform technology appears to be inexpensive enough and simple
                              enough to be within the reach of most nations of the world, as well as
                              numerous companies and private groups. At present, it seems likely
                              that the first floating cities will be built by crowded industrial societies
                              for the purpose of offshore housing. . . . Multinational corporations may
                              see them as mobile terminals for trade activities, or as factory ships.
                              Food companies may build floating cities to carry out mariculture
                              operations. . . . Corporations seeking tax havens and adventurers
                              seeking new lifestyles may build floating cities and declare them to be
                              new states. Floating cities may achieve formal diplomatic recognition ...
                              or become a vehicle for ethnic minorities to achieve their
                              independence."

                              Technological progress associated with the construction of thousands
                              of offshore oil rigs, some anchored to the bottom but many positioned
                              dynamically with propellers, ballast, and buoyancy controls, are
                              developing very rapidly and laying the basis for the floating city and
                              enormous new supporting industries.

                              Overall, the commercial reasons for moving into the sea are multiplying
                              so swiftly that, according to economist D. M. Leipziger, many large
                              corporations today, "like homesteaders in the Old West, are queuing
                              up waiting for the starter's pistol to stake out large areas of the ocean
                              floor." This also explains why the non-industrial countries are fighting to
                              guarantee that-the resources of the oceans become the common
                              heritage of the human race rather than of the rich nations alone.

                              If we see these various developments not as independent of one
                              another but as interlinked and self-reinforcing, each technological or
                              scientific advance accelerating others, it becomes clear that we are no
                              longer dealing with the same level of technology on which the Second
                              Wave was based. We are on the way to a radically new energy system

                              THE GENE INDUSTRY

                              With information on genetics doubling every two years, with the gene
                              mechanics working overtime, New Scientist magazine reports that
                              "genetic engineering has been going through an essential tooling up
                              phase; it is now ready to go into business." The distinguished science
                              commentator, Lord Ritchie-Calder, explains that "Just as we have
                              manipulated plastics and metals, we are now manufacturing living
                              materials."

                              Major companies are already in hot pursuit of commercial applications
                              of the new biology. They dream of placing enzymes in the automobile
                              to monitor exhaust and send data on pollution to a microprocessor that
                              will then adjust the engine. They speak of what The New York Times
                              calls "metal-hungry microbes that might be used to mine valuable trace
                              metals from ocean water." They have already demanded and won the
                              right to patent new life forms. Eli Lilly, Hoffmann-La Roche, G. D.
                              Searle, Upjohn, and Merck, not to mention General Electric, are all in
                              the race.

                              Nervous critics, including many scientists, justifiably worry that there is
                              a race at all. They conjure up images not of oil spills, but of "microbe
                              spills" that could spread disease and decimate entire populations. The
                              creation and accidental release of virulent microbes, however, is only
                              one cause for alarm. Completely sober and respectable scientists are
                              talking about possibilities that stagger the imagination.

                              many years ago, I suggested that we would eventually be able to "pre-
                              design" the human body, "grow machines," chemically program the
                              brain, make identical carbon copies of ourselves through cloning, and
                              create wholly new and dangerous life-forms. "Who shall control
                              research into these fields?" I asked. "How shall the new findings be
                              applied? Might we not unleash horrors for which man is totally
                              unprepared?"

                              Some readers thought the forecast farfetched. That, however, was
                              before 1973 and the discovery of the recombinant DNA process.
                              Today the same anguished questions are being asked by citizen
                              protesters, congressional committees, and by scientists themselves as

                              "Broad scale genetic engineering will probably be introduced to
                              America much the same way as assembly lines, automobiles,
                              vaccines, computers and all the other technologies. As each new
                              genetic advance becomes commercially practical, a new consumer
                              need . . . will be exploited and a market for the new technology will be
                              created." The potential applications are myriad.

                              The new biology, for example, could potentially help solve the energy
                              problem. Scientists are now studying the idea of utilizing bacteria
                              capable of converting sunlight into electrochemical energy. They speak
                              of "biological solar cells." Could we breed life forms to replace nuclear
                              power plants? And if so, might we substitute the danger of a bioactive
                              release for the danger of radioactive release?

                              In the field of health, many diseases now untreatable will no doubt be
                              cured or prevented—and new ones, perhaps worse, introduced
                              through inadvertence or even malice. (Think what a profit-hungry
                              company could do if it developed and secretly spread some new
                              disease for which it alone had the cure. Even a mild, coldlike ailment
                              could create a massive market for the appropriate, monopolistically
                              controlled cure.)

                              According to the president of Cetus, a California company to which
                              many world-famous geneticists are commercially linked, "biology will
                              replace chemistry in importance" in the next thirty years. And in
                              Moscow an official policy statement urges "the wider use of micro-
                              organisms in the national economy. . .."

                              148 THE THIRD WAVE

                              Biology will reduce or eliminate the need for oil in the production of
                              plastics, fertilizer, clothes, paint, pesticides, and thousands of other
                              products. It will sharply alter the production of wood, wool, and other
                              "natural" goods. Companies like United States Steel, Fiat, Hitachi,
                              ASEA, or IBM will undoubtedly have their own biology divisions as we
                              begin to shift, over time, from manufacture to "biofacture," giving rise to
                              a range of products unimaginable until now. Says Theodore J. Gordon,]]></page><page Index="120"><![CDATA[the head of The Futures Group, "In biology, once we get started, we'll
                              have to think about things like . . . can you make a tissue-compatible
                              shirt' or a 'mammary mattress'—created out of the same stuff as the
                              human breast."

                              Long before then, hi agriculture, genetic engineering will be employed
                              to increase the world food supply. The much-publicized Green
                              Revolution of the 1960's proved, in large measure, a colossal trap for
                              farmers hi the First Wave world because it required enormous inputs of
                              petroleum-based fertilizer that had to be bought abroad. The next bio-
                              agricultural revolution aims at reducing that dependence on artificial
                              fertilizer. Genetic engineering points toward high-yielding crops, crops
                              that grow well in sandy or salty soil, crops that fight off pests. It also
                              seeks to create entirely new foods and fibers, along with simpler,
                              cheaper, energy-conserving methods for storing and processing foods.
                              As though to balance off some of its awesome peril, genetic
                              engineering once more holds out for us the possibility of ending
                              widespread famine.

                              One must remain skeptical of these glowing promises. Yet if some of
                              the advocates of genetic farming are half right, the impact on
                              agriculture could be tremendous, ultimately altering, among other
                              things, relations between the poor countries and the rich. The Green
                              Revolution made the poor more, not less, dependent on the rich. The
                              bio-agricultural revolution could do the reverse.

                              It is too early to say with confidence how biotechnology will develop.
                              But it is too late to turn back to zero. We cannot undiscover what we
                              know. We can only fight to control its application, to prevent hasty
                              exploitation, to transoational-ize it, and to minimize corporate, national,
                              and interscientific rivalry in the entire field before it is too late.

                              One thing is immutably clear: we are no longer locked into the three-
                              hundred-year-old electromechanical frame of traditional Second Wave
                              technology, and can only begin to glimpse the full significance of this
                              historic fact.

                              THE COMMANDING HEIGHTS

                              Just as the Second Wave combined coal, steel, electricity, and rail
                              transport to produce automobiles and a thousand other life-
                              transforming products, the real impact of the new changes will not be
                              felt until we reach the stage of combining the new technologies —
                              linking together computers, electronic new materials from outer space
                              and the oceans, with ge-

                              netics, and allof these, in turn, with the new energy base. Bringing
                              these elements together will release a flood of innovation unlike any
                              seen before in human history. We are constructing a dramatically new
                              techno-sphere for a Third Wave-civilization.

                              THETECHNO-REBELS

                              The magnitude of such an advance—its importance for the future of
                              evolution itself—makes it critically necessary that we begin to guide it.
                              To adopt a hands-off, damn-the-tor-pedoes approach could spell doom]]></page><page Index="121"><![CDATA[for ourselves and our children. For the power, scale, and speed of the

                              10 crashes, the hard-to-plug massive oil spill off the Mexican coast,
                              and a hundred other technological horrors. Faced with such disasters,
                              can we permit the development and combination of tomorrow's even
                              more powerful technologies to be controlled by the same shortsighted
                              and selfish criteria used during the Second Wave era?

                              The basic questions asked of new technologies during the past three
                              hundred years, in both capitalist and socialist nation's, have been
                              simple: do they contribute to economic gain or military clout? These
                              twin criteria are clearly no longer adequate. New technologies will have
                              to pass far stiffer tests-—ecological and social as well as economic
                              and strategic.

                              When we look closely at what a report to the U.S. Na-tional Science
                              Foundation has called "technology and social shock"—a catalog of
                              technological calamities in recent years—we discover that most of
                              them are associated with Second Wave, not Third Wave technologies.
                              The reason is obvious: Third Wave technologies have not yet been
                              deployed on a grand scale. Many are still in their infancy.
                              Nevertheless, we can already glimpse the dangers of electronic smog,
                              information pollution, combat in outer space, genetic leakage, climatic
                              intervention, and what might be called "eco-

                              logical warfare"—the deliberate induction of earthquakes, for example,
                              by triggering vibrations from a distance. Beyond this lies a host of other
                              perils associated with the advance to a new technological base.

                              Under these circumstances it is no surprise that recent years have
                              seen massive, almost indiscriminate, public resistance to new
                              technology. The early period of the Secotid Wave also saw attempts to
                              block new technology. As early as 1663, London workers tore down
                              the new mechanical sawmills that threatened their livelihood. In 1676
                              ribbon workers smashed their machines. In 1710 rioters protested the
                              newly introduced stocking frames. Later, John Kay, inventor of the
                              flying shuttle used in the textile mills, saw his home wrecked by an
                              infuriated mob and ultimately fled England altogether. The most
                              publicized example came in 1811 when machine wreckers calling
                              themselves Luddites destroyed their textile machines in Nottingham.

                              Yet this early antagonism to the machine was sporadic and
                              spontaneous. As one historian notes, many of the cases "were not so
                              much the result of hostility to the machine itself as a method of
                              coercing an obnoxious employer." Unlettered workingmen and women,
                              poor, hungry, and desperate, saw in the machine a threat to their
                              individual survival.

                              Today's rebellion against runaway technology is different. It involves a
                              fast-growing army of people—by no means poor or unlettered—who
                              are not necessarily anti-technological, or opposed to economic growth,]]></page><page Index="122"><![CDATA[but who see in the uncontrolled technological thrust a threat to
                              themselves and to global survival.

                              Some fanatics among them, given the chance, might well employ
                              Luddite tactics. It doesn't take much to imagine the bombing of a
                              computer installation or a genetic laboratory or a partially constructed
                              nuclear reactor. One can even more easily picture some particularly
                              hideous technological disaster triggering a witch-hunt for the white-
                              coated scientists who "caused it all." Some demagogic politician of the
                              future may well rise to fame by investigating the "Cambridge Ten" or
                              the "Oak Ridge Seven."

                              However, most of today's techno-rebels are neither bomb-throwers nor
                              Luddites. They include thousands of people who are themselves
                              scientifically trained—nuclear engineers, bio-chemist, physicians,
                              public health officials, and geneticists as well as millions of ordinary
                              citizens. Again, unlike the Luddites, they are well organized and
                              articulate. They publish

                              their own technical journals and propaganda. They file law-suits and
                              draft legislation, as well as picket, march, and demonstrate.

                              This movement, often attacked as reactionary, is actually a

                              vital part of the emerging Third Wave. For its members are the leading
                              edge of the future in a three-way political and economic battle that
                              parallels, in the field of technnology, the

                              struggle over energy that we have described earlier.

                              Here, too, we see Second Wave forces on one side, First Wave
                              reversionists on the other, and Third Wave forces struggling against
                              both. Here the Second Wave forces are those who favor the old,
                              mindless approach to technology: ""If it works, produce it. It it sells,
                              produce it. If it makes us strong, build it." Imbued with obsolete, indust-
                              real notions of progress, many of these adherents of the Second Wave
                              past have vested interests in the irresponsible application of
                              technology. They shrug off the dangers.

                              On the other side, we find once more a small, vocal fringe of romantic
                              extremists hostile to all but the most primitive First Wave technologies,
                              who seem to favor a return to medieval crafts and hand labor. Mostly
                              middle-class, speaking from the vantage point of a full belly, their
                              resistance to technological advance is as blindly indiscriminate as the
                              support of technology by Second Wave people. They fantasize about a
                              return to a world that most of us—and most of them— would find
                              abhorrent.

                              Ranged against both these extremes is an increasing number of
                              people in every country who form the core of the techno-rebellion.
                              They are, without knowing it, agents of the Third Wave. They begin not
                              with technology but with hard questions about what kind of future
                              society want. They recognize that we now have so many technological
                              opportunities we can no longer fund, develop, and apply them all. They
                              argue, therefore, the need to select more carefully among them and to]]></page><page Index="123"><![CDATA[choose those technologies that serve long-range social and ecological

                              over the larger directions of the technological thrust.

                              The techno-rebels have not as yet formulated a clear, comprehensive
                              program. But if we extrapolate from their numer ous manifestos,
                              petitions, statements, and studies, we can identify several streams of
                              thought that add up to a new way of looking at technology—a positive
                              policy for managing the transition to a Third Wave future.

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              The techno-rebels start from the premise that the earth's biosphere is
                              fragile, and that the more powerful our new technologies become, the

                              demand that all new technologies be prescreened for possible adverse
                              effects, that dangerous ones be redesigned or actually blocked—in
                              short, that tomorrow's technologies be subjected to tighter ecological

                              The techno-rebels argue that either we control technology or it controls
                              us—and that "we" can no longer simply be the usual tiny elite of
                              scientists, engineers, politicians, and businessmen. Whatever the
                              merits of the antinuclear campaigns that have erupted in West
                              Germany, France, Sweden, Japan, and the United States, the battle
                              against Concorde, or the rising demands for regulation of genetic
                              research, all reflect a widespread passionate demand for the
                              democratization of technological decision-making.

                              The techno-rebels contend that technology need not be big, costly, or
                              complex in order to be "sophisticated." The heavy-handed
                              technologies of the Second Wave seemed more efficient than they
                              actually were because corporations and socialist enterprises
                              externalized—transferred to society as a whole—the enormous costs
                              of cleaning up pollution, of caring for the unemployed, or dealing with
                              work-alienation. When these are seen as costs of production, many
                              seemingly efficient machines turn out to be quite the opposite.

                              Thus the techno-rebels favor the design of a whole range of
                              "appropriate technologies" intended to provide humane jobs, to avoid
                              pollution, to spare the environment and to produce for personal or local
                              use rather than for national and global markets alone. The techno-
                              rebellion has sparked thousands of experiments all over the world, with
                              just such small-scale technologies, in fields ranging from fish farming
                              and food processing to energy production, waste recycling, cheap
                              construction, and simple transport.

                              While many of these experiments are naive and hark back to a
                              mythical past, others are more practical. Some reach out for the latest
                              materials and scientific tools and combine them in new ways with old
                              techniques. Jean Gimpel, for example, the historian of medieval]]></page><page Index="124"><![CDATA[technology, has built elegant models of simple tools that might prove

                              another example—use of a by-passed technology that can now be

                              payload capacity. Airships are ecologically sound and could be used
                              for slow but cheap and safe transport in regions where there are no
                              roads—Brazil, perhaps, or Nigeria. Experiments with appropriate or
                              alternative technologies, especially in the energy field, suggest that
                              some simple, small-scale technologies can be as "sophisticated" as
                              complex, large-scale technologies when the full range of side effects is
                              taken into account and when the machine is properly matched to the
                              task.

                              The techno-rebels are also disturbed by the radical imbalance of
                              science and technology on the face of the planet, with only 3 percent of
                              the world's scientists in countries containing 75 percent of the global
                              population. They favor devoting more technological attention to the
                              needs of the world's poor, and a more equitable sharing of the
                              resources of outer space and the oceans. They recognize that not only
                              are the oceans and skies part of the common heritage of the race, but
                              that advanced technology itself could not exist without the historic
                              contributions of many peoples, from the Indians and Arabs to the
                              ancient Chinese.

                              Finally, they argue that in moving into the Third Wave we must
                              advance, step by step, from the resource-wasteful, pollution-producing
                              system of production used during the Second Wave era toward a more
                              "metabolic" system that eliminates waste and pollution by making sure
                              that the output and byproduct of each industry becomes an input for
                              the next. The goal is a system under which no output is produced that
                              is not an input for another production process downstream. Such a
                              system is not only more efficient in a production sense, it minimizes, or
                              indeed, eliminates, damage to the bio-sphere.

                              Taken as a whole, this techno-rebel program provides the

                              basis for humanizing the technological thrust.

                              The techno-rebels are, whether they recognize it or not, agents of the
                              Third Wave. They will not vanish but multiply in the years ahead. For
                              they are as much a part of the advance to a new stage of civilization as
                              our missions to Venus, our amazing computers, our biological
                              discoveries, or our explorations of the oceanic depths.

                              within much tightened ecological and social controls, with equally
                              sophisticated, "low-stream" industries that operate on a smaller, more

                              which governed the Second Wave techno-sphere. Together, these two
                              layers of industry will form tomorrow's "commanding heights."

                              But this is only a detail of a much vaster picture. For at the same time
                              that we are transforming the techno-sphere we are also revolutionizing
                              the info-sphere.

                              DE-MASSIYFING THE MEDIA

                              The espionage agent is one of the most powerful metaphors of our
                              time. No other figure has so successfully captured the contemporary
                              imagination. Films by the hundred glorify 007 and his brash fictional
                              counterparts. Television and paperbacks churn out endless images of
                              the spy as daring, romantic, amoral, larger (or smaller) than life.
                              Governments, meanwhile, spend billions on espionage. Agents of the
                              KGB, the CIA, and a score of other intelligence agencies trip over one
                              another from Berlin to Beirut, from Macao to Mexico City.

                              In Moscow, western correspondents are accused of spying. In Bonn,
                              chancellors fall because spies infest their ministries. In Washington,
                              congressional investigators simultaneously expose the misdeeds of
                              secret agents, American and Korean, while above, the sky itself is
                              rilled with spy satellites apparently photographing every inch of the
                              earth.

                              The spy is hardly new to history. It is worth asking, therefore, why at
                              this particular moment the theme of espionage has come to dominate
                              the popular imagination, throwing even private eyes, cops, and
                              cowboys into the shadow. When we do ask, we immediately notice one
                              important difference between the spy and these other culture heroes:
                              While fictional policemen and cowboys rely on mere pistols or their
                              bare fists, the fictional spy comes equipped with the latest, most exotic
                              technology—electronic bugs, banks of computers, infrared cameras,
                              cars that fly or swim, helicopters, one-man submarines, death rays,
                              and the like.

                              There is, however, a deeper reason for the rise of the spy,

                              156 THE THIRD WAVE

                              Cowboys, cops, private eyes, adventurers, and explorers—the
                              traditional heroes of print and celluloid—typically pursue the tangible:
                              they want land for cattle, they want money, they want to capture the
                              crook or gain the girl. Not so the spy. For the spy's basic business is
                              informalion—and information has become perhaps the world's fastest
                              growing and most important business. The spy is a living symbol of the
                              revolution now sweeping the info-sphere.

                              A WAREHOUSE OF IMAGES]]></page><page Index="126"><![CDATA[An information bomb is exploding in our midst, showering us with a
                              shrapnel of images and drastically changing the way each of us
                              perceives and acts upon our private world. In shifting from a Second
                              Wave to a Third Wave info-sphere, we are transforming our own
                              psyches.

                              Each of us creates in his skull a mind-model of reality—a warehouse of
                              images. Some of these are visual, others auditory, even tactile. Some
                              are only "percepts"—traces of information about our environment, like
                              a glimpse' of blue sky seen from the corner of the eye. Others are
                              "linkages" that define relationships, like the two words "mother" and
                              child." Some are simple, others complex and conceptual, like the idea
                              that "inflation is caused by rising wages." Together such images add
                              up to our picture of the world—locating us in time, space, and the
                              network of personal relationships around us.

                              These images do not spring from nowhere. They are formed, in ways
                              we do not understand, out of the signals or information reaching us
                              from the environment. And as our environment convulses with
                              change—as our jobs, homes, churches, schools, and political
                              arrangements feel the impact of the Third Wave—the sea of
                              information around us also changes.

                              Before the advent of mass media, a First Wave child growing up in a
                              slowly changing village built his or her model of reality out of images
                              received from a tiny handful of sources—the teacher, the priest, the
                              chief or official and, above all, the family. As psychologist-futurist
                              Herbert Gerr juoy has noted: "There was no television or radio in the
                              home to give the child a chance to meet many different kinds of
                              strangers from many different walks of life and even from different
                              countries. . . . Very few people ever saw a foreign

                              city. . . . The result [was that] people had only a small number of
                              different people to imitate or model themselves after,

                              "Their choices were even more limited by the fact that the people they
                              could model themselves after were themselves all of limited
                              experience with other people." The images of the world built up by the
                              village child, therefore, were extremely narrow in range.

                              The messages he or she received, moreover, were highly redundant in
                              at least two senses: they came, usually, in the form of casual speech,
                              which is normally filled with pauses and repetitions, and they came in
                              the form of connected "strings" of ideas reinforced by various
                              information givers. The child heard the same "thou shalt nots" in
                              church and in school. Both reinforced the messages sent out by the
                              family and the state. Consensus in the community, and strong
                              pressures for conformity, acted on the child from birth to narrow still
                              further the range of acceptable imagery and behavior.]]></page><page Index="127"><![CDATA[The Second Wave multiplied the number of channels from which the
                              individual drew his or her picture of reality. The child no longer
                              received imagery from nature or people alone but from newspapers,
                              mass magazines, radio and, later on, from television. For the most
                              part, church, state, home, and school continued to speak hi unison,
                              reinforcing one another. But now the mass media themselves became
                              a giant loudspeaker. And their power was used across regional, ethnic,
                              tribal, and linguistic lines to standardize the images flowing in society's
                              mind-stream.

                              Certain visual images, for example, were so widely mass-distributed
                              and were implanted in so many millions of private memories that they
                              were transformed, in effect, into icons. The image of Lenin, jaw thrust
                              out in triumph under a swirling red flag, thus became as iconic for
                              millions of people as the image of Jesus on the cross. The image of
                              Charlie Chaplin with derby and cane, or Hitler raging at Nuremberg,

                              and thousands of different, universally recognizable commercial
                              products—the bar of Ivory soap in the United States, the Morinaga
                              chocolate in Japan, the bottle of Perrier in France—all became
                              standard parts of a universal image-file.

                              158 THE THIRD WAVE

                              This centrally produced imagery, injected into the "mass mind" by the
                              mass media; helped produce the standardization of behavior required
                              by the Industrial production system.

                              Today the Third Wave is drastically altering all this. As change
                              accelerates in society it forces a parallel acceleration within us. New
                              information reaches us and we are forced to revise our image-file
                              continuously at a faster and faster rate. Older images based on past
                              reality must be replaced, for, unless we update them, our actions
                              become divorced from reality and we become progressively less
                              competent. We find it impossible to cope.

                              This speedup of image processing inside «s means that images grow
                              mqre and more ^empnrary^Thrnwawav art, one-shot sitcoms, Polaroid
                              snapshots, Xerox copies, and disposable graphics pop up and vanish.
                              Ideas, beliefs, and attitudes skyrocket into consciousness, are
                              challenged, defied, and suddenly fade into nowhere-ness; Scientific
                              and psychological theories are overthrown and superseded daily.
                              Ideologies crack. Celebrities pirouette fleetingly across our awareness.
                              Contradictory political and moral slogans assail us.

                              It is difficult to make sense of this swirling phantasmagoria, to
                              understand exactly how the image-manufacturing process is changing.
                              For the Third Wave does more than simply accelerate our information
                              flows: it transforms the deep structure of information on which our daily
                              actions depend.

                              THE DE-MASSIFIED MEDIA]]></page><page Index="128"><![CDATA[Throughout the Second Wave era the mass media grew more and
                              more powerful. Today a startling change is taking place. As the Third
                              Wave thunders in, the mass media, far from expanding their influence,
                              are suddenly being forced to share it. They are being beaten back on
                              many fronts at once by what I call the "de-massified media."

                              Newspapers provide the first example. The oldest of the Second
                              Wave'mass media, newspapers are losing their readers. By 1973 U.S.
                              newspapers had reached a combined aggregate circulation of 63
                              million copies daily. Since 1973, however, instead of adding circulation,
                              they have begun to lose it. By 1978 the total had declined to 62 million
                              and worse was in store. The percentage of Americans who read a
                              paper every day also fell, from 69 percent in 1972 to 62 per-

                              cent in 1977, and some of the nation's most important papers were the
                              hardest hit. In New York, between 1970 and 1976, the three major
                              dailies combined lost 550,000 readers. The Los Angeles Times, having
                              peaked in 1973, went on to lose 80,000 readers by 1976. The two big
                              Philadelphia papers dropped 150,000 readers, the two big Cleveland
                              papers 90,-000 and the two San Francisco papers more than 80,000.
                              While numerous smaller papers cropped up in many parts of the
                              country, major U.S. dailies like the Cleveland News, the Hartford
                              Times, the Detroit Times, Chicago Today, or the Long Island Press all
                              fell by the wayside. A similar pattern appeared in Britain where,
                              between 1965 and 1975, the national dailies lost fully 8 percent of their
                              circulation.

                              Nor were such losses due merely to the rise of television. Each of
                              today's mass-circulation dailies now faces increasing competition from
                              a burgeoning flock of mini-circulation weeklies, biweeklies, and so-
                              called "shoppers" that serve not the metropolitan mass market but
                              specific neighborhoods and communities within it, providing far more
                              localized advertising and news. Having reached saturation, the big-city
                              mass-circulation daily is in deep trouble. De-massified media are
                              snapping at its heels.*

                              Mass magazines offer a second example. From the mid-1950's on,
                              hardly a year has passed without the death in the United States of a
                              major magazine. Life, Look, the Saturday Evening Post—each went to
                              its grave, later to undergo resurrection as a small-circulation ghost of
                              its former self.

                              Between 1970 and 1977, despite a 14 million rise in U.S. population,
                              the combined aggregate circulation of the remaining top twenty-five
                              magazines dropped by 4 million.

                              Simultaneously, the United States experienced a population explosion
                              of mini-magazines—thousands of brand new magazines aimed at
                              small, special-interest, regional, or even local markets. Pilots and
                              aviation buffs today can choose among literally scores of periodicals
                              edited just for them. Teen-agers,]]></page><page Index="129"><![CDATA[* Some publishers do not consider newspapers to be mass media
                              because many have small circulations and serve small communities.
                              But most papers, at least in the United States, are filled with nationally
                              produced "boilerplate"—news from the AP and UPI wires, comic strips,
                              crosswords, fashions, feature articles—which are largely the same
                              from one city to the next. To compete with the smaller, more localized
                              media the larger papers are increasing local coverage and adding a
                              variety of special-interest sections. The surviving dailies of the 1980's
                              and 1990's will be drastically changed by the segmentation of the
                              reading public.

                              scuba divers, retired people, women athletes, collectors of antique
                              cameras, tennis nuts, skiers, and skateboarders each have their own
                              press. Regional magazines like New York, New West, D in Dallas, or
                              Pittsburgher, are all multiplying. Some slice the market up even more
                              finely by both region and special interest—the Kentucky Business
                              Ledger, for example, or Western Farmer.

                              With new, fast, cheap short-run printing presses, every organization,
                              community group,"p61iTicaT or religious cult and cultiet today can
                              afford to print its own publication. Even smaller groups churn our
                              periodicals on the copying machines that have become ubiquitous in
                              American offices. The mass magazine has lost its once powerful
                              influence in national life. The de-massified magazine-—the mini-
                              magazine—is rapidly taking its plage.

                              But the ifnpactof the Third Wave in communications is not confine'd'to
                              th6 print media. Between iff^O and 1910 the nrrmber ot radio stations
                              jn tne unuea Slates climbed from 2,336, to 5,359. In a period when
                              population rose only 35 percent, radio stations increased by 129
                              percent. This means that instead of one station for every 65,000
                              Americans, there is now one for every 38,000, and it means the
                              average listener has more programs to choose from. The mass
                              audience is cut up among more stations.

                              The diversity of offerings, has also sharply increased, with different
                              stations appealing to specialized audience segments instead of to the
                              hitherto undifferentiated mass audience. All-news stations aim at
                              educated middle-class adults. Hard rock, soft rock, punk rock, country
                              rock, and folk rock stations each aim at a different sector of the youth
                              audience. Soul music stations aim at Black Americans. Classical music
                              stations cater to upper-income adults, foreign language stations to
                              different ethnic groups, from the Portuguese in New England to
                              Italians, Hispanics, Japanese, and Jews. Writes political columnist
                              Richard Reeves, "In Newport, R.I., I cheeked the AM radio dial and
                              found 38 stations, three of them religious, two programmed for blacks
                              and one broadcasting in Portuguese."

                              Relentlessly, newer forms of audio communication chip away at what
                              remains of the mass audience. During the 1960's tiny, cheap tape
                              recorders and cassette players spread like prairie fire among the

                              the sixties. From an average of 4.8 hours a day in 1967, the amount of
                              radio listening time plummeted to 2.8 hours in 1977.

                              Then came citizens band radio. Unlike broadcast radio, which is strictly
                              one-way (the listener cannot talk back to the programmer), CB radios
                              in cars make it possible for drivers within a five- to fifteen-mile radius to
                              communicate with each other.

                              Between 1959 and 1974, only one million CB sets came into use in
                              America. Then, hi the words of an astounded official of the Federal
                              Communications Commission, "It took eight months [for us] to get the
                              second million and three months to get the third." CB blasted off. By
                              1977 some 25 million CB sets were in use, and the airwaves were
                              filled with colorful chatter—from warnings that "smokies" (police) were
                              setting speed traps, to prayers and prostitutes' solicitations. The fad is
                              now over, but its effects are not.

                              Radio broadcasters, nervous about their advertising revenues,
                              vigorously deny that CB has cut into radio listener-ship. But the ad
                              agencies are not so sure. One of them, Marsteller, Inc., conducted a
                              survey in New York and found that 45 percent of CB users report a 10
                              to 15 percent drop in listening to their regular car radios. More
                              significantly, the survey found that over half the CB users listened to
                              both their car radios and their CBs simultaneously.

                              In any case, the shift toward jiiyersity^in print is paralleled in radio. The
                              soundscape is being"de-massified along with the "printscape.

                              Not until 1977, however, did the Second Wave media suffer their most
                              startling and significant defeat. For a generation the .most powerful
                              and the most "massifying" of the media has, of course, been television.
                              In 1977 the picture tube began to flicker. Wrote Time magazine, "All
                              fall, broadcast and ad executives nervously peeked at the figures . . .
                              they could not believe what they were seeing. . . . For the first time in
                              history, television viewing declined."

                              "Nobody," mumbled one astonished ad man, "ever assumed that
                              viewership would go down."

                              Even now explanations abound. We are told the shows are even more
                              miserable than in the past. That there is too much of this and not
                              enough of that. Executive heads have rolled down the network
                              corridors. We have been promised this or that new type of show. But
                              the deeper truth is only beginning to emerge from the clouds of tele-
                              hype. The day of the all-

                              Indeed, a former president of NBC, charging the three main U.S.
                              television networks with strategic "stupidity," has predicted their share
                              of the prime-time viewing public would drop to 50 percent by the late
                              1980's. For the Third Wave communications media are subverting the
                              dominance of the Second Wave media lords on a broad front.

                              Cable television today already reaches into 14.5 million American
                              homes and is likely to spread with hurricane force in the early 1980's.
                              Industry experts expect 20 to 26 million cable subscribers by the end of
                              1981, with cabling available to fully 50 percent of U.S. households.
                              Things will move even faster once the shift is made from copper wires
                              to cheap fiber optic systems that send light pulsing through hair-thin
                              fibers. And like short-run printing presses or Xerox copiers, cable de-
                              massifies the audience, carving it into multiple mini-publics. Moreover,
                              cable systems can be designed for two-way communication so that
                              subscribers may not merely watch programs but actively call various
                              services.

                              In Japan, by the early 1980's entire towns will be linked to light-wave
                              cable, enabling users to dial requests not only for programs but for still
                              photographs, data, theater reservations, or displays of newspaper and
                              magazine material. Burglar and fire alarms will work through the same
                              system.

                              In Ikoma, a bedroom suburb of Osaka, I was interviewed on a TV show
                              on the experimental Hi-Ovis system, which places a microphone and
                              television camera on top of the TV set in the home of every subscriber,
                              so that viewers can become senders as well. As I was being
                              interviewed by the program host, a Mrs. Sakamoto, viewing the
                              program from her own living room, switched in and began chatting with
                              us in broken English. I and the viewing public saw her on the screen
                              and watched her little boy romping around the room as she welcomed
                              me to Ikoma.

                              Hi-Ovis also keeps a bank of video cassettes on everything from music
                              to cooking to education. Viewers can punch in a code number and
                              request the computer to play a particular cassette for them on their
                              screen at whatever hour they wish to see it.

                              Though it involves only about 160 homes, the Hi-Ovis experiment is
                              backed by the Japanese government and contributions from such
                              corporations as Fujitsu, Sumitomo Electric, Matsushita, and Kintetsu. It
                              is extremely advanced and already based on fiber optics technology.

                              In Columbus, Ohio, a week earlier, I had visited Warner Cable
                              Corporation's Qube system. Qube provides the subscriber with thirty
                              TV channels (as against four regular broadcast stations) and presents
                              specialized shows for everyone from preschoolers to doctors, lawyers,
                              or the "adults only" audience. Qube is the most well-developed,
                              commercially effective two-way cable system in the world. Providing]]></page><page Index="132"><![CDATA[each subscriber with what looks like a hand-held calculator, it permits
                              him or her to communicate with the station by push button. A viewer
                              using the so-called "hot buttons" can communicate with the Qube
                              studio and its computer. Time, in describing the system, waxes
                              positively rhapsodic, noting that the subscriber can "voice his opinions
                              in local political debates, conduct garage sales and bid for objets d'art
                              in a charity auction. ... By pressing a button, Joe or Jane Columbus
                              can quiz a politician, or turn electronic thumbs down or up on a local
                              amateur talent program." Consumers can "comparison-shop the local
                              supermarkets" or book a table at an Oriental restaurant.

                              Cable, however. is not the only worry facing the networks, Video
                              games, have become a "hot item" in the stores. Millions of Americans
                              have discovered a passion for gadgets that convert a TV screen into a
                              Ping-Pong table, hockey rink, or tennis court. This development may
                              seem trivial or irrelevant to orthodox political or social analysts. Yet it
                              represents a wave of social learning, a premonitory training, as it were,
                              for life in the electronic environment of tomorrow. Not only do video
                              games further de-massify the audience and cut into the numbers who
                              are watching the programs broadcast at any given moment, but
                              through such seemingly innocent devices millions of people are
                              learning to play with the television set, to talk back to it, and to interact
                              with it. In the process they are changing from passive receivers to
                              message senders as well. They are manipulating the set rather than
                              merely letting the set manipulate them.

                              Information services, fed through the TV screen, are now already
                              available in Britain where a viewer with an adapter unit can push a
                              button and select which of a dozen or so different data services he or
                              she wants—news, weather, financial, sports, and so forth. This data
                              then moves across the TV screen as though on ticker tape. Before
                              long users will no doubt be able to plug a hard-copier into the TV to
                              capture on paper any images they wish to retain. Once again there is
                              wide choice where little existed before.

                              Video cassette players and recorders are spreading rapidly as well.
                              Marketers expect to see a million units in use in the United States by
                              1981. These not only allow viewers to tape Monday's football match for
                              replay on, say, Saturday (thus demolishing the synchronization of
                              imagery that the networks promote), but lay the basis for the sale of
                              films and sports events on tape. (The Arabs are not asleep at the
                              proverbial switch: the movie The Messenger, about the life of
                              Muhammad, is available in boxed cassettes with gilt Arabic lettering on
                              the outside.) Video recorders and players also make possible the sale
                              of highly specialized cartridges containing, for example, medical
                              instructional material for hospital staff, or tapes that show consumers
                              how to assemble knockdown furniture or rewire a toaster. More
                              fundamentally, video record-ers make it possible for anv consumer to
                              become, in addition, a producer of his or her, own imagery. Once again
                              the audience is de-massified.

                              Domestic satellites, finally, make it possible for individual television
                              stations to form temporary mini-networks for specialized programming
                              by bouncing signals from anywhere to anywhere else at minimal cost,
                              thus end-running the existing networks. By the end of 1980 cable-TV
                              operators will have one thousand earth stations in place to pick up]]></page><page Index="133"><![CDATA[satellite signals. "At that point," says Television/Radio Age, "a program
                              distributor need only buy time on a satellite, presto, he has a
                              nationwide cable TV network ... he can selectively feed any group of
                              systems he chooses." The satellite, declares William J. Donnelly, vice-

                              advertising agency, "means smaller audiences and a greater
                              multiplicity of nationally distributed programs."

                              All these different developments have one_thing in com-mon; they
                              slice the mass tfelevision public into segments, and each slice not only
                              increases, our cultural diversity. it cuts deeply into the power of the
                              networks that have until now so-completely dominated our imagery.
                              John O'Connor, the perceptive critic of The New York Times, sums it
                              up simply. "One thing is certain," he writes. "Commercial television will
                              no longer be able to dictate either what is watched or when it is
                              watched."

                              What appears on the surface to be a set of unrelated events turns out
                              to be a wave of closely interrelated changes sweeping across the
                              media horizon from newspapers and radio at one end to magazines
                              and television at the other. The mass

                              media are under attack. New, de-massified media are proliferating,
                              challenging—and sometimes even replacing—the mass media that
                              were so dominant in all Second Wave societies. The Third Wave thus
                              begins a truly new era—the age of

                              the de-massifled media. A new info-sphere is emerging along side the
                              new techno-sphere. And this will have a far-reaching impact on the
                              most important sphere of all, the one inside our skulls. For taken
                              together, these changes revoutionize our images of the world and our
                              ability to make some sense of it.

                              BLIP CULTURE

                              The de-massification of the media de-massifies our minds as well.
                              During the Second Wave era the continual pounding of standardized
                              imagery pumped out by the media created what critics called a "mass
                              mind." Today, instead of masses of people all receiving the same
                              messages, smaller de-massi-fied groups receive and send large
                              amounts of their own imagery to one another. As the entire society
                              shifts toward Third Wave diversity, the new media reflect and
                              accelerate the process.

                              This, in part, explains why opinions on everything from pop music to
                              politics are becoming less uniform. Consensus shatters. On a personal
                              level, we are all besieged and blitzed by fragments of imagery,
                              contradictory or unrelated, that shake up our old ideas and come
                              shooting at us in the form of broken or disembodied "blips." We live, in
                              fact, in a "blip culture."]]></page><page Index="134"><![CDATA["Fiction increasingly stakes out smaller and smaller chunks of territory,"
                              complains critic Geoffrey Wolff, adding that each novelist "apprehends
                              less and less of any big picture." In nonfiction, writes Daniel Laskin,
                              reviewing such phenomenally popular reference works as The
                              People's Almanac and The Book of Lists, "The idea of any exhaustive
                              synthesis seems untenable. The alternative is to collect the world at
                              random, especially its more amusing shards." But the breakup of our
                              images into blips is hardly confined to books or literature. It is even
                              more pronounced in the press and the electronic media.

                              In this new kind of culture, with its fractured, transitory images, we can
                              begin to discern a widening split between Second Wave and Third
                              Wave media users.

                              and ideological certainties of the past, are annoyed and disoriented by
                              the information blitz. They are nostalgic for radio programs of the
                              1930's or movies of the 1940's. They feel cut off from the new media
                              environment, not merely because much of what they hear is
                              threatening or upsetting, but because the very packages in which
                              information arrives are unfamiliar.

                              Instead of receiving long, related "strings" of ideas, organized or
                              synthesized for us, we are increasingly exposed to short, modular blips
                              of information--ads, commands, theo-ries, shreds of news, truncated
                              bits and blobs that refuse to fit neatly into our pre-existing mental files.
                              The new imagery resists classification, partly because it often falls
                              outside our old conceptual categories, but also because it comes in
                              packages that are too oddly shaped, transient, and disconnected.
                              Assailed by what they perceive as the bedlam of blip culture, Second
                              Wave people feel a suppressed rage at the media.

                              Third Wave people, by contrast, are more at ease in the midst of this
                              bombardment of blips—the ninety-second news-clip intercut with a
                              thirty-second commercial, a fragment of song and lyric, a headline, a
                              cartoon, a collage, a newsletter item, a computer printout. Insatiable
                              readers of disposable paperbacks and special-interest magazines,
                              they gulp huge amounts of information in short takes. But they also
                              keep an eye out for those new concepts or metaphors that sum up or
                              organize blips into larger wholes. Rather than trying to stuff the new
                              modular data into the standard Second Wave catego-ries or
                              frameworks, they learn to make their own, to form their own "strings"
                              out of the blipped material shot at them

                              by the new media.

                              Instead of merely receiving our mental model of reality, we are now
                              compelled to invent it andcontinually reinvent it. This places an
                              enormous burden onus. But it also leads toward greater individuality, a
                              de-massification of personality as well as culture. Some of us crack

                              between its constituent parts if the entirety is to hold together,
                              particularly under the stress of high change. An organization, for
                              example, must be able to predict (more or less) how other
                              organizations will respond to change, if it is to plan its own moves
                              sensibly. And the same goes for individuals. The more uniform we are,
                              the less we need to know about each other in order to predict one
                              another's behavior. As the people around us grow more individ-ualized
                              or de-massified, we need more information—signals

                              and cues--to predict even roughly, how they are going to be-have
                              toward us. And unless we can make such forecasts we cannot work or
                              even live together.

                              As a result, people and organizations continually crave more
                              information and the entire system begins to pulse with higher and
                              higher flows of data. By forcing up the amount of information needed
                              for the social system to cohere, and the speeds at which it must be
                              exchanged, the Third Wave shat-ters the framework of the obsolete,
                              overloaded Second Wave info-sphere and constructs a new one to
                              take its place.

                              ENVIRONMENT

                              Many different people of the world believed—and some still do—that
                              behind the immediate physical reality of things lie spirits, that even
                              seemingly dead objects, rocks or earth, have a living force within them:
                              mono. The Sioux Indians called it wakan. The Algonkians, manitou.
                              The Iroquois, orenda. For such people the entire environment is alive.

                              Today, as we construct a new info-sphere for a Third Wave civilization,
                              we are imparting to the "dead" environment around us not life but
                              intelligence.

                              The key to this revolutionary advance is, of course, the computer. A
                              combination of electronic memory with programs that tell the machine
                              how to process the stored data, computers were still a scientific
                              curiosity in the early 1950's. Between 1955 and 1965, however, the]]></page><page Index="136"><![CDATA[decade when the Third Wave began its surge in the United States,
                              they began to seep slowly into the business world. At first they were
                              stand-alone units of modest capacity, employed chiefly for financial
                              purposes. Soon machines with huge capacity began moving into
                              corporate headquarters and were deployed for a variety of tasks. From
                              1965 to 1977, says Harvey Poppel, a senior vice president of Booz
                              Allen & Hamilton, the management consultants, we were hi the "era of
                              the large central computer. .. . It represents the epitome, the ultimate
                              manifestation of machine age thinking. It is the crowning
                              achievement—a large super-computer buried hundreds of feet beneath
                              the center [in a] bombproof . . . antiseptic environment ... manned by a
                              bunch of super-technocrats."

                              So impressive were these centralized giants that they soon 168

                              became a standard part of social mythology. Movie makers,
                              cartoonists, and science fiction writers, using them to symbolize the
                              future, routinely pictured the computer as an all-powerful brain—a
                              massive concentration of superhuman intelligence.

                              During the 1970's, however, fact outraced fiction, leaving obsolete
                              imagery behind. As miniaturization advanced with lightning rapidity, as
                              computer capacity soared and prices per function plunged, small,
                              cheap, powerful mini-computers began to sprout everywhere. Every
                              branch factory, laboratory, sales office or engineering department
                              claimed its own. So many computers appeared, in fact, that companies
                              sometimes lost track of how many they had. The "brainpower" of the
                              computer was no longer concentrated at a single point; it was
                              "distributed."

                              This dispersion of computer intelligence is now moving ahead at high
                              speed. In 1977 expenditures for what is now called "distributed data
                              processing," or DDP, ran to $300 million in the United States.
                              According to the International Data Corporation, a leading market
                              research firm in the field, this figure will reach a solid $3 billion by
                              1982. Small, cheap machines, no longer requiring a specially trained
                              computer priesthood, will soon be as omnipresent as the typewriter.
                              We are "smartening" our work environment.

                              Outside the confines of industry and government, moreover, a parallel
                              process is under way based on that soon-to-be-ubiquitous gadget: the
                              home computer. Five years ago the number of home or personal
                              computers was negligible. Today it is estimated that 300,000
                              computers are whirring and buzzing away in living rooms, kitchens,
                              and dens from one end of America to the next And this is before the
                              major manufacturers, like IBM and Texas Instruments, launch their
                              sales drives. Home computers will soon be selling for little more than a
                              television set.

                              These clever machines are already being used for everything from
                              doing the family taxes to monitoring energy use in the home, playing

                              The Source also makes it possible for anyone with a cheap computer

                              to one another or to large numbers of people all at once, and store all
                              correspondence in electronic memory. The Source will even facilitate
                              the creation of what might be called "electronic communities"—groups
                              of people with shared interests. A dozen photo buffs in a dozen cities,
                              brought together electronically by The Source, can converse to their
                              heart's delight about cameras, equipment, darkroom techniques,
                              lighting, or color film. Months later they can retrieve their comments
                              from The Source's electronic memory, by subject, date, or other
                              category.

                              The dispersal of computers into the home, not to mention their
                              interconnection hi ramified networks, represents another advance in
                              the construction of an intelligent environment. Yet even this is not all.

                              The spread of machine intelligence reaches another level altogether
                              with the arrival of microprocessors and microcomputers, those tiny
                              chips of congealed intelligence that are about to become a part, it
                              seems, of nearly all the things we make and use.

                              Apart from their applications in manufacturing processes and business
                              generally, they are already embedded, or soon will be, hi everything
                              from air-conditioners and autos to sewing machines and scales. They
                              will monitor and minimize the waste of energy in the home. They will
                              adjust the amount of detergent and the water temperature for each
                              washing machine load. They will fine-tune the car's fuel system. They
                              will flag us when something needs repair. They will flick on the clock
                              radio, the toaster, the coffee maker, and the shower for us in the
                              morning. They will warm the garage, lock the doors, and perform a
                              vertiginous variety of other humble and not-so-humble tasks.

                              Just how far things might go within a few decades is suggested by
                              Alan P. Hald, a leading microcomputer distributor, in an amusing
                              scenario he calls "Fred the House."

                              According to Hald, "Home computers can already talk, interpret

                              "Imagine," Hald writes. "You're at work, the phone rings. It's Fred, your
                              house. While monitoring the morning news n ports for stories of recent
                              burglaries, Fred picked up a weather bulletin warning of pending heavy
                              rain. This jogged Fred's bubble memories to run a routine roof

                              Fred phoned Slim for advice. Slim is a ranchstyle home down the block
                              . . . Fred and Slim often shared data banks and each knew they were
                              programmed with an effective search technique for identifying

                              The fantasy is funny. Yet it spookily catches the feel of life in an
                              intelligent environment. Living in such an environment raises chilling
                              philosophical questions. Will machines take over? Can intelligent
                              machines, especially as they are linked together in mtercommunicating
                              networks, outrun our ability to understand and control them? Will Big
                              Brother some day be able to tap not merely our telephones but our
                              toasters and television sets, keeping tabs on our every move and
                              mood? How dependent should we allow ourselves to become on the
                              computer and the chip? As we pump more and more intelligence into
                              the material environment, won't our own minds atrophy? And what
                              happens if someone or something pulls the plug out of the wall? Will
                              we still have the basic skills needed for survival?

                              For each question there are innumerable counterquestions. Can Big
                              Brother really keep tabs on every toaster and TV set, every car engine
                              and kitchen appliance? When intelligence is distributed widely
                              throughout the entire environment, when it can be activated by users in
                              a thousand places at once, when computer users can communicate
                              with one another without going through the central computer (as they
                              do in many distributed networks), can Big Brother still control things?

                              our own actions. We are likely to change the role of literacy in bur lives.
                              We may even alter our own brain chemistry.

                              Raid's comment about the ability of computers and chip-studded
                              appliances to converse with us is not as blue-sky as it might seem.
                              "Voice data entry" terminals in existence today are already capable of
                              recognizing and responding to a vo-cabularly of one thousand words,
                              and many companies, from giants like IBM or Nippon Electric to
                              midgets like Heuristics, Inc., or Centigram Corporation, are racing to
                              expand that vo-cabularly, simplify the technology, and radically slash
                              the costs. Forecasts for when computers will feel at home with natural
                              language range from upwards of twenty years down to a mere five
                              years, and the implications of this development—on both the economy
                              and the culture—could be tremendous.

                              Today millions of people are excluded from the job market because
                              they are functionally illiterate. Even the simplest jobs demand people
                              capable of reading forms, on-off buttons, paychecks, job instructions,
                              and the like. In the Second Wave

                              hiring office.

                              Yet illiteracy is not the same as stupidity. We know that illiterate people
                              the world over are capable of mastering highly sophisticated skills in
                              activities as diverse as agriculture, construction, hunting, and music.
                              Many illiterates have prodigious memories and can speak several
                              languages fluently—something most university-educated Americans
                              cannot do. In Second Wave societies, however, illiterates were
                              economically doomed.

                              Literacy, of course, is more than a job skill. It is the doorway to a
                              fantastic universe of imagination and pleasure. Yet in an intelligent
                              environment, when machines, appliances, and even walls are
                              programmed to speak, literacy could turn out to be less paycheck-
                              linked than it has been for the past three hundred years. Airline]]></page><page Index="140"><![CDATA[reservation clerks, stock-room personnel, machine operators, and

                              errors—sometimes dangerous ones. There is nothing magical about
                              them, and they are assuredly not "spirits" or *'souls" in our
                              environment. Yet with all these qualifications, they remain among the
                              most amazing and unsettling of human achievements, for they
                              enhance our mind-power as Second Wave technology enhanced our
                              muscle-power, and we do not know where our own minds will
                              ultimately lead us.

                              As we grow more familiar with the intelligent environment, and learn to
                              converse with it from the time we leave the cradle, we will begin to use
                              computers with a grace and naturalness that is hard for us to imagine
                              today. And they will help all of us—not just a few "super-
                              technocrats'*—to think more deeply about ourselves and the world.

                              Today, when a problem arises we immediately seek to discover its
                              causes. However, until now even the most profound thinkers have
                              usually attempted to explain things in terms of a relative handful of
                              causal forces. For even the best human mind finds it difficult to
                              entertain, let alone manipulate, more than a few variables at a time.* In

                              a child is delinquent, or why inflation ravages an economy, or how

                              collectively, be far more important.

                              Worse yet, each group of experts typically insists on the primal
                              importance of "its own" causes, to the exclusion of others. Faced with
                              the staggering problems of urban decay, the Housing Expert traces it
                              to congestion and a declining housing stock; the Transportation Expert
                              points to the lack of mass transit; the Welfare Expert shows the
                              inadequacy of budgets for day-care centers or social work; the Crime
                              Expert points a finger at the infrequency of police patrols; the
                              Economics Expert shows that high taxes are discouraging business
                              investment; and so on. Everyone high-mindedly agrees that all these
                              problems are somehow interconnected— that they form a self-
                              reinforcing system. But no one can keep the many complexities in
                              mind while trying to think through a solution to the problem.

                              Urban decay is only one of a large number of what Peter Ritner, in The
                              Society of Space, once felicitously termed "weave problems." He
                              warned that we would increasingly face crises that were "not
                              susceptible to 'cause and effect analysis' but would require 'mutual
                              dependence analysis'; not composed of easily detachable elements

                              patterns. It can help assemble "blips'* into larger, more meaningful
                              wholes. Given a set of assumptions or a model, it can trace out the

                              At the same time, the intelligent environment may eventually begin to
                              change not merely the way we analyze problems and integrate
                              information, but even the chemistry of our brains. Experiments by
                              David Krech, Marian Diamond, Mark Rosenzweig, and Edward
                              Bennett, among others, have shown that animals exposed to an
                              "enriched" environment have larger cerebral cortices, more glial cells,
                              bigger neurons, more active neurotransmitters, and larger blood
                              supplies to the brain than animals in a control group. Can it be that, as
                              we complexify the environment and make it more intelligent, we shall
                              make ourselves more intelligent as well?

                              Dr. Donald F. Klein, Director of Research at New York Psychiatric
                              Institute, one of the world's leading neuropsychia-trists, speculates:

                              "Krech's work suggests that among the variables affecting intelligence
                              is the richness and responsiveness of the early environment. Kids
                              brought up in what might be called a 'stupid' environment—
                              understimulating, poor, unresponsive—soon learn not to take chances.
                              There's little margin for error, and it actually pays off to be cautious,
                              conservative, uninquisitive or downright passive, none of which works
                              wonders for the brain.

                              "On the other hand, kids raised in a smart, responsive environment,
                              which is complex and stimulating, may develop a different set of skills.
                              If kids can call on the environment to do things for them, they become

                              all we can do is guess. But it is not impossible that an intelligent
                              environment could lead us to develop new synapses and a larger
                              cortex. A smarter environment might make smarter people."

                              All this, however, only begins to hint at the larger significance of the
                              changes the new info-sphere brings with it. I'or the de-massification of
                              the media and the concomitant rise of the computer together change
                              our social memory.

                              176 THE THIRD WAVE

                              THE SOCIAL MEMORY

                              All memories can be divided into those that are purely personal or
                              private and those that are shared or social. Unshared private
                              memories die with the individual. Social memory lives on. Our
                              remarkable ability to file and retrieve shared memories is the secret of
                              our species' evolutionary success. And anything that significantly alters
                              the way we construct, store, or use social memory therefore touches
                              on the very wellsprings of destiny.

                              Twice before in history humankind has revolutionized its social
                              memory. Today, in constructing a new info-sphere, we are poised on
                              the brink of another such transformation.

                              In the beginning, human groups were forced to store their shared
                              memories in the same place they kept private memories—i.e., in the
                              minds of individuals. Tribal elders, wise men, and others carried these
                              memories with them hi the form of history, myth, lore, and legend, and
                              transmitted them to then: children through speech, song, chant, and
                              example. How to light a fire, the best way to snare a bird, how to lace a
                              raft or pound taro, how to sharpen a plowstick or care for the oxen—all
                              the accumulated experience of the group was stored in the neurons
                              and glia and synapses of human beings.

                              So long as this remained true, the size of the social memory was
                              sorely limited. No matter how good the memories of the elderly, no
                              matter how memorable the songs or lessons, there was only so much
                              storage space in the skulls of any population.

                              Second Wave civilization smashed the memory barrier. It spread mass
                              literacy. It kept systematic business records. It built thousands of
                              libraries and museums. It invented the file cabinet. In short, it moved
                              social memory outside the skull, found new ways to store it, and thus
                              expanded it beyond its previous limits. By increasing the store of
                              cumulative knowledge, it accelerated all the processes of innovation
                              and social change, giving Second Wave civilization the most rapidly
                              changing and developing culture the world until then had known.

                              Today we are about to jump to a whole new stage of social memory.

                              computerization of corporate files—all mean we are recording the
                              activities of the civilization hi fine-grain detail. Unless we incinerate the
                              planet, and our social memory with it, we shall before long have the
                              closest thing to a civilization with total recall. Third Wave civilization will
                              have at its disposal more information, and more finely organized
                              information, about itself than could have been imagined even a
                              quarter-century ago.

                              The shift to a Third Wave social memory, however, is more than just
                              quantitative. We are also, as it were, imparting life to our memory.

                              When social memory was stored in human brains it was continually
                              being eroded, refreshed, stirred about, combined and recombined in
                              new ways. It was active, or dynamic. It was, in the most literal sense,
                              alive.

                              When industrial civilization moved much of social memory outside the
                              skull, that memory became objectified, embedded in artifacts, books,
                              payroll sheets, newspapers, photographs, and films. But a symbol
                              once inscribed on a page, a photo once captured on film, a newspaper
                              once printed, remained passive or static. Only when these symbols
                              were fed into a human brain again did they come alive, to be
                              manipulated or recombined hi fresh ways. While Second Wave
                              civilization radically expanded social memory, it also froze it.

                              What makes the leap to a Third Wave info-sphere so historically
                              unprecedented a situation: it makes social memory both extensive and
                              active. And this combination will prove to be propulsive.

                              Activating this newly expanded memory will unleash fresh cultural
                              energies. For the computer not only helps us organize or synthesize
                              "blips" into coherent models of reality, it also stretches the far limits of
                              the possible. No library or file cabinet could think, let alone think in an
                              unorthodox fashion. The computer, by contrast, can be asked by us to
                              "think the unthinkable" and the previously unthought. It makes possible
                              a flood of new theories, ideas, ideologies, artistic insights, technical
                              advances, economic and political innovations that were, in the most
                              literal sense, unthinkable and unimaginable before now. In this way, it
                              accelerates historic change and fuels the thrust toward Third Wave
                              social diversity.

                              In all previous societies the info-sphere provided the means for
                              communication between humans. The Third Wave multiplies these
                              means. But it also provides powerful facilities, for

                              the larger picture, it becomes clear that the revolution in the info-
                              sphere is at least as dramatic as that in the techno-sphere—in the
                              energy system and technological base of society.

                              The work of constructing a new civilization is racing forward on many
                              levels at once.

                              BEYOND MASS PRODUCTION

                              One day not long ago I drove a rented car from the snow-swathed
                              peaks of the Rocky Mountains down along snaky roads, then across
                              the high plains, and down, down again until I reached the eastern
                              foothills of that majestic mountain range. There in Colorado Springs,
                              under a brilliant sky, I made my way to a long, low building complex
                              that nestled along the highway, dwarfed by the peaks looming behind
                              me.

                              As I entered the building, I remembered again the factories in which I
                              had once worked, with all their clatter and roar, their dirt, smoke, and
                              suppressed anger. For years, ever since leaving our manual jobs, my
                              wife and I have been "factory voyeurs." In all our travels around the
                              globe, instead of zeroing in on ruined cathedrals and tourist clip joints
                              we have made it our business to see how people work. For nothing I
                              ells us more about their culture. And now in Colorado Springs I was
                              once again visiting a factory. I had been told (hat it was among the
                              most advanced manufacturing facilities in the world.

                              It soon became clear why. For, in plants like this, one glimpses the
                              latest hi technology and the most advanced information systems—and
                              the practical effects of their convergence.

                              This Hewlett-Packard facility turns out $100 million worth a year of
                              electronic apparatus—cathode-ray tubes for use in TV monitors and
                              medical equipment, oscilloscopes, "logic analyzers" for testing, and
                              even more arcane items. Of the 1,-700 people employed here, fully 40
                              percent are engineers,

                              programmers, technicians, clerical or managerial personnel. They work
                              in a huge, high-ceilinged open space. One wall is a giant picture
                              window that frames an imposing view of Pikes Peak. The other walls
                              are painted bright yellow and white. The floors are light-colored vinyl,
                              gleaming and hospital clean.

                              The workers at H-P, from clerks to computer specialists,, from the plant
                              manager to assemblers and inspectors, are not separated spatially but
                              work together in open bays. Instead of shouting to one another over a
                              machine clatter, they speak in normal conversational tones. Because
                              everyone wears ordinary street clothes there are no visible distinctions
                              of rank or task. Production employees sit at their own benches or]]></page><page Index="145"><![CDATA[desks; so many of these are decorated with trailing ivy, flowers, and
                              other greenery that, from some visual angles, one has the fleeing
                              illusion of being in a garden.

                              Striding through this facility, I thought how poignant it would be if I
                              could magically lift some of my old mates out of the foundry and auto
                              assembly line, put of the racket, the dirt, the hard bruising manual
                              labor, and the rigidly authoritarian discipline that accompanied it, and
                              transplant them into this new-style work environment.

                              They would stare in wonder at what they saw. I doubt very much that
                              H-P is a workers' paradise, and my blue collar friends would not be
                              easily fooled. They would demand to know, item by item, the pay
                              schedules, the fringe benefits, the grievance procedures, if any. They
                              would ask whether the exotic new materials being handled hi this plant
                              are really safe or whether there are environmental health hazards.
                              They would assume rightly that even under the seemingly casual
                              relationships some people give orders and others take them.

                              Nevertheless, my old friends' shrewd eyes would take in much that is
                              new and sharply different from the classical factories they knew. They
                              would notice, for example, that instead of all the H-P employees
                              arriving at once, punching the clock, and racing to their work stations,
                              they are able, within limits, to choose their own individual working
                              hours. Instead of being forced to stay in one work location, they are
                              able to move about as they wish. My old friends would marvel at the
                              freedom of the H-P employees, again within limits, to set their own
                              work pace. To talk to managers or engineers without worrying about
                              status or hierarchy. To dress as they wish. In short, to be individuals. In
                              fact, my old companions in their heavy steel-tipped shoes, dirty
                              overalls, and working-

                              men's caps would find it hard, I believe, to think of the place us a
                              factory at all.

                              And if we regard the factory as the home of mass production, they
                              would be right. For mass production is not whnt this facility is all about.
                              We have moved beyond mass production.

                              MOUSE MILK AND T-SHIRTS

                              It is conventional knowledge by now that the percentage of workers
                              employed in manufacturing in the "advanced" nations has declined in
                              the past twenty years. (In the United States today only 9 percent of the
                              total population—20 million workers—manufacture goods for some 220
                              million people. The remaining 65 million workers provide services and
                              manipulate symbols.) And as this shrinkage of manufacturing has
                              accelerated in the industrial world, more and more routine
                              manufacturing has been farmed out to the so-called developing
                              countries, from Algeria to Mexico and Thailand. Like rusty used cars,
                              the most backward Second Wave industries are thus exported from the
                              rich nations to the poor.]]></page><page Index="146"><![CDATA[For strategic as well as economic reasons, the rich nations cannot
                              afford to surrender manufacturing altogether, and they will not become
                              pure examples of "service societies" or "information economies." The
                              image of the rich world living off nonmaterial production while the rest
                              of the world engages in the output of material goods is highly
                              oversimplified. Instead, we will find the rich nations continuing to
                              manufacture key goods—but needing fewer workers to do so. For we
                              are transforming the very way goods are made.

                              The essence of Second Wave manufacture was the long "run" of
                              millions of identical, standardized products. By contrast, the essence of
                              Third Wave manufacture is the short run of partially or completely
                              customized products.

                              The public still tends to think of manufacture in terms of long runs, and
                              we do of course continue to turn out cigarettes by the billion, textiles by
                              the millions of yards, light bulbs, matches, bricks, or spark plugs in
                              astronomical quantities. No doubt we will continue to do so for some
                              time. Yet these are precisely the products of the more backward
                              industries rather than the most advanced, and today they account for
                              only about 5 percent of all our manufactured goods.

                              between U.S. $1000-2000 per capita per annum—concentrate on
                              mass produced manufactures" the "most highly developed countries . .
                              . concentrate on the export of one-off and short-run manufactured

                              In Japan, West Germany, the United States, even in the Soviet Union,
                              in such fields as electrical manufacturing, chemicals, aerospace,
                              electronics, specialized vehicles, communications, and the like, we find
                              the trend toward de-massi-fication well developed. At Western
                              Electric's super-advanced plant in northern Illinois, for example,
                              workers make over four hundred different "circuit packs" in runs that
                              range from a maximum of two thousand a month all the way down to
                              two a month. At Hewlett-Packard in Colorado Springs, production runs
                              as small as fifty to one hundred units are com* mon.

                              At IBM, Polaroid, McDonnell Douglas, Westinghouse, and General
                              Electric in the United States, at Plessey and ITT in Great Britain, at
                              Siemens in Germany or Ericsson in Sweden, the same shift toward
                              short run and customized products is marked. In Norway the Aker
                              Group, which once accounted for 45 percent of that nation's ship
                              construction, has shifted to the manufacture of off-shore oil equipment.
                              The result: a switch from "series production" of ships to "tailor-made"
                              offshore products.]]></page><page Index="147"><![CDATA[In chemicals, meanwhile, according to executive R. E. Lee, Exxon is
                              "moving to short runs in fabricated products—polypropylene and
                              polyethelyne in extruded plastics for pipe, sidings, panelling, etc. In
                              Paramins we are doing increasing custom work." Some of the runs are
                              so small, Lee adds, "we call them 'mouse-milk' runs."

                              In military production most people still think in terms of mass—but the
                              reality is "de-mass." We think of millions of identical uniforms, helmets,
                              rifles. In fact, the vast bulk of what a modern military establishment
                              needs is not mass produced at all. Jet fighters can be produced in runs
                              as small as ten to fifty at a time. Each one of these may be slightly
                              different, depending on purpose and branch of service. And with such
                              small orders, many of the components that go into the planes are
                              usually produced in short runs also.

                              Thus an eye-opening analysis of Pentagon spending by the number of
                              end-products purchased came up with the finding I hat, out of $9.1
                              billion spent on goods for which the number of end items was
                              identifiable, fully 78 percent ($7.1 billion) went for goods produced in
                              lots of under 100 units!

                              Even in fields where components are still mass-produced in very large
                              quantities—and in some highly advanced industries this is still the
                              case—the components are usually configured to form many different
                              end-products, each of which is in turn produced in short runs.

                              One need only look at the incredibly diverse vehicles whizzing down an
                              Arizona highway to recognize how the once relatively uniform auto
                              market has splintered into segments, forcing even those technological
                              tyrannosaurs, the auto makers, to back grudgingly into partial
                              customization. The car manufacturers in Europe, the United States,
                              and Japan now mass-manufacture components and sub-assemblies,
                              then plug them together in myriad ways.

                              At another level, note the humble T-shirt. The shirts are mass-made.
                              But new, cheap fast-heat presses make it economical to imprint
                              designs or slogans on very small batches. The result is a wild flowering
                              of shirts facetiously identifying the wearer as a Beethoven fan, a beer
                              drinker, or a porno star. Autos, T-shirts, and many other products
                              represent a halfway stage between mass and de-massified
                              manufacture.

                              The step beyond this, of course, is complete customization—the actual
                              manufacture of one-of-a-kind products. And that is clearly the direction
                              in which we are heading: products custom-cut for individual users.

                              According to Robert H. Anderson, head of the Information Services
                              Department at the Rand Corporation, and an expert on advanced
                              manufacturing: "It will be no harder in the near future to custom
                              produce something . . . than it is to mass produce . . . today. . . . We're
                              beyond the modularization stage where you make a lot of modules and]]></page><page Index="148"><![CDATA[plug them together . . . and we're getting on to the stage of just plain
                              custom production. Just like clothes."

                              The shift toward customization is perhaps best symbolized by a
                              computer-based laser gun introduced a few years ago into the
                              clothing.industry. Before the Second Wave brought mass production, if
                              a man wanted a piece of clothing made he went to a tailor or a
                              seamstress, or his wife sewed it. Tn any case, it was done on a
                              handcraft basis, to his individual measure. All sewing was essentially
                              custom tailoring.

                              184 THE THIRD WAVE

                              After the arrival of the Second Wave, we began to manufacture
                              identical clothes on a mass-production basis. Under this system the
                              worker placed one layer of cloth on top of another; he laid a pattern on
                              top; then, with an electric cutting knife he cut around the edges of the
                              pattern and produced multiple, identical cutouts of the cloth. These
                              were then subjected to identical processing and came out identical in
                              size, shape, color, and so forth.

                              The new laser machine operates on a radically different principle. It
                              does not cut 10 or 50 or 100 or even 500 shirts or jackets at a time. Its
                              cuts one at a time. But it acutally cut faster and cheaper than the
                              mass-production methods employed until now. It reduces waste and
                              eliminates the need for inventory. For these reasons, according to the
                              president of Genesco, one of the largest manufacturers of apparel in
                              the United States, "The laser machines can be programmed to fill an
                              order for one garment economically." What that suggests is that some
                              day even standard sizes may disappear. It ma} be possible to read
                              one's measurements into a telephone, 01 point a video camera at
                              oneself, thus feeding data directly into a computer, which in turn will
                              instruct the machine to produce a single garment, cut exactly to one's
                              personal, individualized dimensions.

                              What we are looking at, in effect, is custom tailoring on a high-
                              technology basis. It is the reinstatement of a system of production that
                              flourished before the industrial revolution— but now built on the basis
                              of the most advanced, sophisticated technology. Just as we are de-
                              massifying the media, we are de-massifying manufacture.

                              Several other quite extraordinary advances are transforming the way
                              we make things.

                              As some industries move from mass to small batch production, others
                              are already moving beyond that toward full customization on a
                              continuous-flow basis. Instead of starting and stopping production at
                              the beginning and end of each short run, they are advancing to the
                              point at which the machines can continuously reset themselves, so that
                              the units of output—each one different from the next—stream from the
                              machines hi an unbroken flow. In a nutshell, we are racing

                              Another significant change, as we shall shortly see, brings the
                              customer more directly than ever before into the manufacturing
                              process. In some industries we are only a step removed from a
                              situation in which a customer-company pipes its specifications directly
                              into the manufacturer's computers, which will in turn control the
                              production line. As this practice becomes widespread, the customer
                              will become so integrated into the production process that we will find it
                              more and more difficult to tell just who is actually the consumer and
                              who the producer.

                              Finally, while Second Wave manufacture was Cartesian in the sense
                              that products were broken into pieces, then painstakingly reassembled,
                              Third Wave manufacture is post-Cartesian or "wholistic." This is
                              illustrated by what has happened to common manufactured products
                              like the wristwatch. Whereas watches once had hundreds of moving
                              parts, we are now able to make solid-state watches that are more
                              accurate and reliable—with no moving parts at all. Similarly, today's
                              Panasonic TV set has half as many parts as the sets of ten years ago.
                              As tiny microprocessors—those miracle chips again—turn up in more
                              and more products, they replace impressive numbers of conventional
                              components. Exxon introduces the "Qyx"—a new typewriter with only a
                              handful of moving parts as against the hundreds in the IBM Selectric.
                              Similarly, a well-known 35mm camera, the Canon AE-1, is now made
                              with 300 fewer parts than the model it superseded. Fully 175 of these
                              were replaced by a single Texas Instruments chip.

                              By intervening at the molecular level, by using computer-aided design
                              or other advanced manufacturing tools, we integrate more and more
                              functions into fewer and fewer parts, substituting "wholes" for many
                              discrete components. What is occurring can be compared to the rise of
                              photography in the visual arts. Instead of making a picture by placing
                              innumerable daubs of paint on a canvas, the photographer "makes"
                              the entire image at once by pressing a button. We are beginning to see
                              this "presto effect" hi manufacturing.

                              The pattern becomes clear, therefore. Vast changes in the techno-
                              sphere and the info-sphere have converged to change the way we
                              make goods. We are moving rapidly beyond traditional mass
                              production to a sophisticated mix of mass and de-massified products.
                              The ultimate goal of this effort is now

                              continuous-flow processes, increasingly under the direct control of the
                              consumer.

                              In brief, we are revolutionizing the deep structure of production,

                              THE DEATH OF THE SECRETARY?

                              As fewer workers in the rich nations have engaged in physical
                              production, more have been needed to produce ideas, patents,
                              scientific formulae, bills, invoices, reorganization plans, files, dossiers,
                              market research, sales presentations, letters, graphics, legal briefs,
                              engineering specifications, computer programs, and a thousand other
                              forms of data or symbolic output. This rise in white-collar, technical,
                              and administrative activity has been so widely documented in so many
                              countries that we need no statistic here to make the point. Indeed,
                              some sociologists have seized on the increasing abstraction of
                              production as evidence that society has moved into a "post-industrial"
                              stage.

                              The facts are more complicated. For the growth of the white-collar
                              work force can be better understood as an extension of industrialism—
                              a further last surge of the Second Wave—than as a leap to a new
                              system. While it is true that work has grown more abstract and less
                              concrete, the actual offices in which this work is being done are
                              modeled directly after Second Wave factories, with the work itself
                              fragmented, repetitive, dull, and dehumanizing. Even today, much
                              office reorganization is little more than an attempt to make the office
                              more closely resemble a factory.

                              In this "symbol-factory," Second Wave civilization also created a
                              factorylike caste system. The factory work force is divided into manual
                              and nonmanual workers. The office is similarly divided into "high
                              abstraction" and "low abstraction" workers. At one level we find the
                              high abstracters, the technocratic elites: scientists, engineers, and
                              managers, crwch of whose time is taken up with meetings,
                              conferences, business lunches, or in dictating, drafting memos, placing

                              phone calls, and otherwise exchanging information. One recent survey
                              estimated that 80 percent of the manager's time is spent in 150 to 300
                              "information transactions" daily.

                              At the other level we find the low abstractors—white-collar proletarians,
                              as it were—who, like factory workers throughout the Second Wave
                              period, perform endlessly routine and deadening work. Mostly female
                              and nommionized, this group can justifiably smile with irony at the
                              sociologists' talk of "post-industrialism." They are the industrial work
                              force of the office.

                              Today the office, too, is beginning to move beyond the Second Wave
                              and into the Third, and this industrial caste system is about to be
                              challenged. All the old hierarchies and structures of the office are soon
                              to be reshuffled.]]></page><page Index="151"><![CDATA[The Third Wave revolution in the office is the result of several colliding
                              forces. The need for information has mushroomed so wildly that no
                              army of Second Wave clerks, typists, and secretaries, no matter how
                              large or hard-working, can possibly cope with it. In addition, the cost of
                              paper work has climbed so calamitously that a frantic search is
                              underway to control it. (Office costs have swelled to 40 or 50 percent of
                              all costs in many companies, and some experts estimate that the
                              expense of preparing a single business letter can run as high as $14 to
                              $18 when all the hidden factors are taken into account.) Moreover,
                              while the average factory worker in the United States today is
                              supported by an estimated $25.000 worth of technology, the office
                              worker, as one Xerox salesman puts it, "works with $500 or $1000
                              worth of old typewriters and adding machines, and is probably among
                              the least productive workers in the world." Office productivity has
                              climbed a bare 4 percent over the past decade, and conditions in other
                              countries are probably even more pronounced.

                              Contrast this with the extraordinary decline in the cost of computers, as
                              measured by the number of functions performed. It has been estimated
                              that computer output has increased 10,000 times in the past fifteen
                              years, and that the per-function cost today is down 100,000-fold. The
                              combination of rising costs and stagnating productivity on the one hand
                              and computer advances on the other make an irresistible combination.
                              The result is likely to be nothing less than a "wordquake."

                              called the word processor—some 250,000 of which are already at work
                              in U.S. offices. Manufacturers of these machines, including such titans
                              as IBM and Exxon, are bracing themselves to compete in what they
                              believe will soon be a $10-billion-a-year market. Sometimes called a
                              "smart typewriter" or a "text editor," this device fundamentally alters the
                              flow of information in the office, and with it the job structure. It is,
                              however, only one of a great family of new technologies about to
                              deluge the white-collar world.

                              In Chicago in June 1979, at the convention of the International Word
                              Processing Association, some 20,000 perspiring visitors trooped
                              through an exhibition hall to examine or try out a bewildering array of
                              other machines as well—optical scanners, high-speed printers,
                              micrographic equipment, facsimile machines, computer terminals, and
                              the like. They were looking at the beginning of what some term the
                              "paperless office" of tomorrow.

                              In Washington, D.C., in fact, a consulting firm known as Micronet, Inc.
                              has brought together the equipment of seventeen different
                              manufacturers into an integrated office in which paper is verboten. Any
                              document arriving in this office is instantly microfilmed and stored for
                              computer retrieval later on. This demonstration office and training
                              facility integrates dictating equipment, microfilm, optical scanners, and
                              video terminals into a functioning system. The objective, says Micronet
                              president Larry Stockett, is an office of the future in which "there are no
                              misfiles; marketing, sales, accounting and research data are always up
                              to the minute; information is reproduced and distributed at hundreds of]]></page><page Index="152"><![CDATA[thousands of pages per hour for a fraction of a cent per page; and . . .
                              information is converted back and forth from print to digital to
                              photographic media at will."

                              The key to such an office of the future is ordinary correspondence. In a
                              conventional Second Wave office, when an executive wants to fire off
                              a letter or memo, an intermediary is called in—the secretary. This
                              person's first task is to capture the executive's words on paper—in a
                              notebook or a typed draft. Next the message is corrected to eliminate
                              errors, and perhaps retyped a few times. After that it is clean typed. A
                              carbon or Xerox copy is made. The original is dispatched to its
                              destination through the mailroom or the post office. The duplicate is
                              filed. Not counting the initial step of composing the message, five
                              distinct sequential steps are required.

                              BEYOND MASS PRODUCTION

                              189

                              Today's machines compress these five steps into one, making the
                              sequential all but simultaneous.

                              To learn how-—and to speed up my own work—I bought a simple
                              computer, used it as a word processor, and wrote the latter half of this
                              book on it. To my pleasure, I found I could master the machine in a
                              single short session. Within a few hours I was using it fluently. After
                              more than a year at the keyboard I am still amazed by its speed and
                              power.

                              Today, instead of typing a draft of a chapter on paper, I type on a
                              keyboard that stores it in electronic form on what is known as a "floppy
                              disk." I see my words displayed before me on a TV-like screen. By
                              punching a. few keys I can instantly revise or rearrange what I have
                              written, shifting paragraphs, deleting, inserting, underlining, until I have
                              a version I like. This eliminates erasing, "whiting out," cutting, pasting,
                              stripping, Xeroxing, or typing successive drafts. Once I have corrected
                              the draft, I press a button, and a printer at my side makes a Jetter-
                              perfect final copy for me at vision-blurring speeds.

                              But making paper copies of anything is a primitive use of such
                              machines and violates their very spirit. For the ultimate beauty of the
                              electronic office lies not merely in the steps saved by a secretary in
                              typing and correcting letters. The automated office can file them in the
                              form of electronic bits on tape or disk. It can (or soon will) pass them
                              through an electronic dictionary that will automatically correct their
                              spelling errors. With the machines hooked up to one another and to the
                              phone lines, the secretary can instantly transmit the letter to its
                              recipient's printer or screen. The equipment thus can capture an
                              original, correct it, duplicate it, send it, and file it in what amounts
                              virtually to a single process. Speed increases. Costs go down. And the
                              five steps are compressed into one.

                              The implications of this compression extend far outside the office. For
                              among other things, this equipment, linked to satellites, microwave,
                              and other telecommunications facilities, makes it possible to end-run
                              that overworked, malfunctioning, classically Second Wave institution,]]></page><page Index="153"><![CDATA[the Post Office. Indeed, the spread of office automation, of which word
                              processing is only a single small aspect, is integrally linked to the
                              creation of "electronic mail" systems to replace the postman and his
                              burdensome bag.

                              In the United States today, fully 35 percent of total domestic postal
                              volume consists of transaction reports: bills, receipts, purchase orders,
                              invoices, bank statements, checks,

                              and the like. However, a vast amount of mail flows not between
                              individuals but between organizations. As the postal crisis has
                              deepened, more and more companies have sought an alternative to
                              the Second Wave postal system and begun to build pieces of a Third
                              Wave system instead.

                              Based on teleprinters, facsimile machines, word processor equipment,
                              and computer terminals, this electronic postal system is spreading very
                              rapidly, especially in the advanced industries, and will be given a
                              further tremendous boost by the new satellite systems.

                              Together, IBM, Aetna Casualty and Surety, and Comsat (the quasi-
                              governmental communications satellite agency) have set up a
                              company called Satellite Business Systems to provide integrated
                              information services to other companies. SBS plans to loft satellites for
                              client firms like General Motors, say, or Hoechst or Toshiba. Together
                              with cheap ground stations located at each company installation, the
                              SBS satellite makes it possible for each company to have, in effect, its
                              own electronic postal system, bypassing in good measure the public
                              postal services.

                              Instead of transporting paper, the new system moves electronic
                              pulses. Even today, notes Vincent Giuliano of the Arthur D. Little
                              research organization, electronics is the "hot" medium in many fields; it
                              is the electronic impulse that effectuates a transaction, with a paper bill
                              or receipt or statement going out afterward merely to validate it. How
                              long the paper will be needed is a matter of dispute.

                              Messages and memos move silently and instantaneously. Terminals at
                              every desk—thousands of them in any large organization—flicker
                              quietly as information flows through the system, bouncing up to a
                              satellite and down to an office halfway around the world or to a
                              terminal in an executive's home. Computers link the company's files
                              with those of other companies where necessary, and managers can
                              call up information stored in hundreds of outside data banks like the
                              New York Times Information Bank.

                              Just how far events move in this direction remains to be seen. The
                              image of the office of the future is too neat, too smooth, too
                              disembodied to be real. Reality is always messy. But it is clear that we
                              are rapidly on our way, and even a partial shift toward the electronic
                              office will be enough to trigger an eruption of social, psychological, and
                              economic consequences. The coming workquake means more than

                              and roles in the office as well.

                              It will, for a start, eliminate many of the secretary's functions. Even
                              typing becomes an obsolete skill in tomorrow's office, when speech-
                              recognition technology arrives. At first typing will still be necessary to
                              capture the messages and put them in transmittable form. But before
                              long, dictation equipment tuned to the distinctive accents of each
                              individual user will convert the sounds into written words, thus entirely
                              bypassing the typing operation.

                              "The old technology used a typist,*' says Dr. Oiuliano, "because it was
                              klutzy. When you had a clay tablet, you needed a scribe who knew
                              how to bake clay and chisel marks on it. Writing was not for the
                              masses. Today we have scribes called typists. But as soon as the new
                              technology makes it easier to capture the message, to correct it, store
                              it, retrieve it, send it and copy it, we will do all those things for
                              ourselves—just like writing and talking. Once the klutz-factor is
                              eliminated, we don't need the typist."

                              Indeed, one dearly held hope of many word-processing experts has
                              the secretary being upgraded and the executive taking on or sharing
                              the typing chore, at least until such time as it is totally eliminated.
                              When I delivered a speech at the International Word Processing
                              convention, for example, I was asked if my secretary uses the machine
                              for me. When I said I typed my own drafts and that, in fact, my
                              secretary could hardly get near my computer/word processor, cheers
                              rang through the room. They dream of a day when the classified
                              section in the newspaper may include ads like:

                              barriers of the past.

                              All of this has raised many fears. Opinion divides sharply between
                              those who insist that millions of jobs will simply vanish (or that today's
                              secretaries will mainly be reduced to mechanical slaves) and a more
                              sanguine view widely held in the word processing industry, and
                              expressed by Randy Gold-field, a principal of the Booz Allen &
                              Hamilton consulting firm. According to Ms. Goldfield, secretaries, far
                              from being reduced to mindless, repetitive processors, will become
                              "para-principals," sharing in some of the professional work and
                              decision-making from which they have been largely excluded until now.
                              More likely we will see a sharp division between those white-collar
                              workers who move up to more responsible positions and those who
                              move down—and eventually out.

                              What, then, happens to these people—and to the economy in general?
                              During the late 1950's and early 1960's, when automation first began
                              arriving on the scene, economists and trade unionists in many
                              countries forecast massive unemployment. Instead, employment in the
                              high-technology nations expanded. As the manufacturing sector
                              shrank the white-collar and service sectors expanded, taking up the
                              slack. But if manufacturing continues to shrink, and if office
                              employment is to be put through the wringer at the same time, where
                              will the jobs of tomorrow come from?

                              Nobody knows. Despite endless studies and vehement claims, the
                              forecasts and the evidence are contradictory. Attempts to relate
                              investment in mechanization and automation to levels of manufacturing
                              employment show what the Financial Times of London calls an "almost
                              complete lack of correlation." Between 1963 and 1973 Japan had the
                              highest rate of investment in new technology, as a percentage of value
                              added, of any country in a seven-nation study. It also had the highest
                              growth in employment. Britain, whose investment in machinery was the
                              lowest, showed the greatest loss of jobs.

                              The American experience roughly paralleled that of Japan— iirlmology
                              and new jobs both increasing—while Sweden, I-ranee, West Germany,
                              and Italy all showed markedly individual patterns,

                              It is clear that the level of employment is not merely a re-flrciion of
                              technological advance. It does not simply rise and full as we automate
                              or fail to do so. Employment is the net result of many converging
                              policies.

                              Pressures on the job market may well increase dramatically in the
                              years ahead. But it is naive to single out the computer as their source.

                              What is certain is that both the office and the factory are destined to be
                              revolutionized in the decades ahead. The twin revolutions in the white-
                              collar sector and in manufacture add up to nothing less than a wholly
                              new mode of production for society—a giant step for the human race.]]></page><page Index="156"><![CDATA[This step carries with it indescribably complex implications. It will affect

                              women in the economy, the nature of work, and the divorce of
                              producer from consumer; it will even alter so seemingly simple a fact
                              as the "where" of work.

                              Hidden inside our advance to a new production system is a potential
                              for social change so breathtaking in scope that few among us have
                              been willing to face its meaning. For we are about to revolutionize our
                              homes as well.

                              Apart from encouraging smaller work units, apart from permitting a
                              decentralization and de-urbanization of production, apart from altering
                              the actual character of work, the new production system could shift
                              literally millions of jobs out of the factories and offices into which the
                              Second Wave swept them and right back where they came from
                              originally: the home. If this were to happen, every institution we know,
                              from the family to the school and the corporation, would be
                              transformed.

                              Watching masses of peasants scything a field three hundred years
                              ago, only a madman would have dreamed that the time would soon
                              come when the fields would be depopulated, when people would
                              crowd into urban factories to earn their daily bread. And only a
                              madman would have been right. Today it takes an act of courage to
                              suggest that our biggest factories and office towers may, within our
                              lifetimes, stand half empty, reduced to use as ghostly warehouses or
                              converted into living space. Yet this is precisely what the new mode of
                              production makes possible: a return to cottage industry on a new,
                              higher, electronic basis, and with it a new emphasis on the home as
                              the center of society.

                              To suggest that millions of us may soon spend our time at home,
                              instead of going out to an office or factory, is to unleash an immediate
                              shower of objections. And there are many 194

                              sensible reasons for skepticism. "People don't want to work at home,
                              even if they could. Look at all the women struggling to get out of the
                              home and into a job!" "How can you get imy work done with kids
                              running around?" "People won't be motivated unless there's a boss
                              watching them." "People need I;ice-to-face contact with each other to
                              develop the trust and confidence necessary to work together." "The
                              architecture of the average home isn't set up for it." "What do you

                              kill the idea." "How about the tax collector? The tax people are getting
                              tougher on deductions claimed for working at home." And the ultimate
                              stopper: "What, and slay home all day with my wife (or husband)?"

                              Even old Karl Marx would have frowned. Working at home, he
                              believed, was a reactionary form of production because "the
                              agglomeration in one workshop" was "a necessary condition for the
                              division of labor in society." In short, there were, and are, many
                              reasons (and pseudoreasons) for regarding the whole idea as silly.

                              DOING HOMEWORK

                              Yet there were equally, if not more, compelling reasons three hundred
                              years ago to believe people would never move out of the home and
                              field to work in factories. After all, they had labored in their own
                              cottages and the nearby land for 10,000 years, not a mere 300. The
                              entire structure of family life, the process of child-rearing and
                              personality formation, the whole system of property and power, the
                              culture, the daily struggle for existence were all bound to the hearth
                              and the soil by a thousand invisible chains. Yet these chains were
                              slashed in short order as soon as a new system of production
                              appeared.

                              Today that is happening again, and a whole group of social and
                              economic forces are converging to transfer the locus of work.

                              To begin with, the shift from Second Wave manufacturing to the new,
                              more advanced Third Wave manufacturing reduces, as we just saw,
                              the number of workers who actually have to manipulate physical
                              goods. This means that even in the manufacturing sector an increasing
                              amount of work is being done that—given the right configuration of
                              telecommu-

                              nicatiom and other equipment—could be accomplished anywhere,
                              including one's own living room. Nor is this just a science fiction
                              fantasy.

                              When Western Electric shifted from producing electromechanical
                              switching equipment for the phone company to making electronic
                              switching gear, the work force at its advanced manufacturing facility in
                              northern Illinois was transformed. Before the changeover, production
                              workers outnumbered white-collar and technical workers three to one.
                              Today the ratio is one to one. This means that fully half of the 2,000
                              workers now handle information instead of things, and much of their
                              work can be done at home. Dom Cuomo, director of engineering at the
                              Northern Illinois facility, put it flatly: "If you include engineers, ten to
                              twenty-five percent of what is done here could be done at home with
                              existing technology."

                              Cuomo's manager of engineering, Gerald Mitchell, went even further.
                              "All told," he stated, "600 to 700 of the 2,000 could now—with existing]]></page><page Index="158"><![CDATA[technology—work at home. And in five years, we could go far beyond
                              that."

                              These informed "guesstimates" are remarkably similar to those made
                              by Dar Howard, manufacturing manager of the Hewlett-Packard factory
                              in Colorado Springs: "We have 1,-000 in actual manufacturing.
                              Technologically, maybe 250 of them could work at home. The logistics
                              would be complicated, but the tooling and capital equipment would not
                              prevent it. In white collar research and development, if you're willing to
                              invest in [computer] terminals, one half to three quarters could also
                              work at home." At Hewlett-Packard that would add up to an additional
                              350 to 520 workers.

                              All told, it means that fully 35 to 50 percent of the entire work force in
                              this advanced manufacturing center could even now do most, if not all,
                              their work at home, providing one chose to organize production that
                              way. Third Wave manufacturing, Marx notwithstanding, does not
                              require 100 percent of the work force to be concentrated in the
                              workshop.

                              Nor are such estimates found in electronic industries alone or in giant
                              enterprises. According to Peter Tattle, vice-president of Ortho
                              Pharmaceutical (Canada) Ltd., the question is not "How many can be
                              permitted to work at home?" but rather, "How many have to work in the
                              office or factory?" Speaking of the 300 employed in his plant, Tattle
                              says: "Fully 75 percent could work at home if we provided the
                              necessary communications technology." Clearly, what applies

                              to electronics and Pharmaceuticals also applies to other advanced
                              industries.

                              If significant numbers of employees in the manufacturing sector could
                              be shifted to the home even now, then it is safe to say that a
                              considerable slice of the white-collar sector— where there are no
                              materials to handle—could also make that transition.

                              Indeed, an unmeasured but appreciable amount of work is already
                              being done at home by such people as salesmen and saleswomen
                              who work by phone or visit, and only occasionally touch base at the
                              office; by architects and designers; by a burgeoning pool of specialized
                              consultants in many industries; by large numbers of human-service
                              workers like therapists or psychologists; by music teachers and
                              language instructors; by art dealers, investment counselors, insurance
                              agents, lawyers, and academic researchers; and by many other
                              categories of white-collar, technical, and professional people.

                              These are, moreover, among the most rapidly expanding work
                              classifications, and when we suddenly make available technologies
                              that can place a low-cost "work station" in any home, providing it with a
                              "smart" typewriter, perhaps, along with a facsimile machine or
                              computer console and teleconferencing equipment, the possibilities for
                              home work are radically extended.]]></page><page Index="159"><![CDATA[Given such equipment, who might be the first to make the transition
                              from centralized work to the "electronic cottage"? While it would be a
                              mistake to underestimate the need for direct face-to-face contact in
                              business, and all the subliminal and nonverbal communication that
                              accompanies that contact, it is also true that certain tasks do not
                              require much outside contact at all—or need it only intermittently.

                              Thus "low-abstraction" office workers for the most part perform tasks—
                              entering data, typing, retrieving, totaling columns of figures, preparing
                              invoices, and the like—that require few, if any, direct face-to-face
                              transactions. They could perhaps be most easily shifted into the
                              electronic cottage. Many of the "ultrahigh-abstraction" workers—
                              researchers, for example, and economists, policy formulators,
                              organizational designers—require both high-density contact with peers
                              and colleagues and 'times to work alone. There are times when even
                              deal-makers need to back off and do their "homework."

                              Nathaniel Samuels, an advisory director of the Lehman Brothers Kuhn

                              "future technology will increase the amount of 'homework.'" Indeed,
                              many companies are already relaxing their insistence that work be
                              done in the office. When Weyerhaeuser, the great timber-products
                              company, needed a new brochure on employee conduct not long ago,
                              Vice-President R. L. Siegel and three of his staff members met at his
                              home for almost a week until they had hammered out a draft. "We felt
                              we needed to get out [of the office], to avoid the distractions," says
                              Siegel. "Working at home is consistent with our shift toward flexible
                              hours," he adds. "The important thing is getting your job done. It's
                              incidental to us where you do it."

                              According to the Wall Street Journal, Weyerhaeuser is not alone.
                              "Many other companies also are letting their employees work at
                              home," the newspaper reports, among them United Airlines, whose
                              director of public relations allows his staff people to write at home as
                              much as 20 days a year. Even McDonald's, whose lower-rung
                              employees are needed to staff the hamburger grills, encourages home
                              work among some top executives.

                              "Do you really need an office as such at all?" asks Booz Allen &
                              Hamilton's Harvey Poppel. In an unpublished forecast, Poppel
                              suggests that "by the 1990s, two-way communications capability [will
                              have been] enhanced sufficiently to encourage a widespread practice
                              of working at home." His view is supported by many other researchers,
                              like Robert F. Latham, a long-range planner at Bell Canada in
                              Montreal. According to Latham, "As information jobs proliferate and
                              communications facilities improve, the number of people who may
                              work at home or at local work centres will also increase."]]></page><page Index="160"><![CDATA[Similarly, Hollis Vail, a management consultant for the United States
                              Department of the Interior, asserts that by the mid-1980's, "tomorrow's
                              word-processing centers" could easily be in one's own home"; he has
                              written a scenario describing how a secretary, "Jane Adams,"
                              employed by the "Afgar Company" could work at home, meeting her
                              boss only periodically to "talk over problems, and, of course, to attend
                              office parties."

                              This same view is shared by the Institute for the Future, which, as early
                              as 1971, surveyed 150 experts in "leading edge" companies dealing
                              with the new information technologies, and spelled out five different
                              categories of work that could be transferred to the home.

                              THE ELECTRONIC COTTAGE

                              199

                              Given the necessary tools, the IFF found, many of the present duties of
                              the secretary "could be done from home as well as in the office. Such a
                              system would increase the labor pool by allowing married secretaries
                              caring for small children ;it home to continue to work. . . . There may be
                              no overriding reason why a secretary could not just as well, in many
                              instances, take dictation at home and type the text on a home terminal
                              which produces a clean text at the author's home or office."

                              In addition, IFF continued, "Many of the tasks performed by engineers,
                              draftsmen, and other white-collar employees might be done from home
                              as readily as, or sometimes more readily than, from the office." One
                              "seed of the future" exists nlready in Britain, for example, where a
                              company called F. International Ltd. (the "F" stands for Freelance)
                              employs 400 part-time computer programmers, all but a handful of
                              whom work in their own homes. The company, which organizes teams
                              of programmers for industry, has expanded to Holland and
                              Scandinavia and counts among its clients such giants as British Steel,
                              Shell, and Unilever. "Home computer programming," writes the
                              Guardian newspaper, is "the cottage industry of the 1980s."

                              In short, as the Third Wave sweeps across society, we find more and
                              more companies that can be described, in the words of one
                              researcher, as nothing but "people huddled around a computer." Put
                              the computer in people's homes, and they no longer need to huddle.
                              Third Wave white-collar work, like Third Wave manufacturing, will not
                              require 100 percent of the work force to be concentrated in the
                              workshop.

                              One should not-underestimate the difficulties entailed in transferring
                              work from its Second Wave locations in factory and office to its Third
                              Wave location in the home. Problems of motivation and management,
                              of corporate and social reorganization will make the shift both
                              prolonged and, perhaps, painful. Nor can all communication be
                              handled vicariously. Some jobs—especially those involving creative
                              deal-making, where each decision is nonroutine—require much face-
                              to-face contact. Thus Michael Koerner, President of Canada Overseas
                              Investments, Ltd,, says, "We all need to be within a thousand feet of
                              one another."]]></page><page Index="161"><![CDATA[THE TELECOMMUTERS

                              Nevertheless, powerful forces are converging to promote the electronic
                              cottage. The most immediately apparent is the economic trade-off
                              between transportation and telecommunication. Most high-technology
                              nations are now experiencing a transportation crisis, with mass transit
                              systems strained to the breaking point, roads and highways clogged,
                              parking spaces rare, pollution a serious problem, strikes and
                              breakdowns almost routine, and costs skyrocketing.

                              The escalating costs of commuting are borne by the individual workers.
                              But they are, of course, indirectly passed on to the employer in the
                              form of higher wage costs, and to the consumer in higher prices. Jack
                              Nilles and a team sponsored by the National Science Foundation have
                              worked out both the dollar and the energy savings that would flow from
                              any substantial shift of white-collar jobs out of centralized downtown
                              offices. Instead of assuming the jobs would go into the homes of
                              employees, the Nilles group used what might be termed a halfway-
                              house model, assuming only that jobs would be dispersed into
                              neighborhood work centers closer to employee homes.

                              The implications of their findings are startling. Studying 2,-048
                              insurance company employees in Los Angeles, the Nilles group found
                              that each person, on average, traveled 21.4 miles a day to and from
                              work (as against a national average of 18.8 miles for urban workers in
                              the United States). The higher up the managerial scale, the longer the
                              commute, with top executives averaging 33.2 miles. All told, these
                              workers drove 12.4 million miles each year to get to work, using up
                              nearly a half-century's worth of hours to do so.

                              At 1974 prices, this cost twenty-two cents per mile, or a total of
                              $2,730,000—an amount borne indirectly by the company and its
                              customers. Indeed, Nilles found that the company was paying its
                              downtown workers $520 a year more than the going rate in the
                              dispersed locations—in effect, "a subsidy of transportation costs." It
                              was also providing parking spaces and other costly services made
                              necessary by the centralized location. If we now assume a secretary
                              was earning in the neighborhood of $10,000 a year, the elimination of
                              this commuting cost could have permitted the company to hire nearly
                              300 additional employees or, alternatively, to add a substantial amount
                              to profits.

                              The key question is: When will the cost of installing and

                              operating telecommunications equipment fall below the present cost of
                              commuting? While gasoline and other transport costs (including the
                              costs of mass-transit alternatives to the auto) are soaring everywhere,
                              the price of telecommunications is shrinking spectacularly.* At some
                              point the curves must cross.

                              But these are not the only forces subtly moving us toward the
                              geographical dispersal of production and, ultimately, the electronic]]></page><page Index="162"><![CDATA[cottage of the future. The Nilles team found that the average American
                              urban commuter uses the gasoline equivalent of 64.6 kilowatts of
                              energy to get back and forth to work each day. (The Los Angeles
                              insurance employees burned 37.4 million kilowatts a year in
                              commuting.) By contrast, it takes far less energy to move information.

                              A typical computer terminal uses only 100 to 125 watts or less when it
                              is in operation, and a phone line consumes only one watt or less while
                              it is in use. Making certain assumptions about how much
                              communications equipment would be needed, and how long it would
                              operate, Nilles calculated that "the relative energy consumption
                              advantage of telecommuting over commuting (i.e., the ratio of
                              commuting energy consumption to telecommuting consumption) is at
                              least 29:1 when the private automobile is used; 11:1 when normally
                              loaded mass transit is used; and 2:1 for 100 per cent utilized mass
                              transit systems."

                              Carried to their conclusion, these calculations showed that in 1975,
                              had even as little as 12 to 14 percent of urban commuting been
                              replaced by telecommuting, the United States would have saved
                              approximately 75 million barrels of gasoline—and would have thereby
                              completely eliminated the need to import any gasoline from abroad.
                              The implications of that one fact for the U.S. balance of payments and
                              for Middle East politics might also have been more than trivial.

                              As gasoline prices and energy costs in general rise in the decades
                              immediately ahead, both the dollar cost and energy costs of operating
                              "smart" typewriters, telecopiers, audio and video links, and home-size
                              computer consoles will plummet,

                              * Satellites slash the cost of long-distance transmission, bringing it so
                              near the zero mark per signal that engineers now speak of "distance-
                              independent" communications. Computer power has multiplied
                              exponentially and prices have dropped so dramatically that engineers
                              and Investors alike are left gasping. With fiber optics and other new
                              breakthrough technologies hi the wings, it is clear that still further cost
                              reductions lie ahead—per unit of memory, per processing step, and
                              per signal transmitted.


                              still further increasing the relative advantage of moving at least some
                              production out of the large central workshops that dominated the
                              Second Wave era.

                              All these mounting pressures toward telecommuting will intensify as
                              intermittent gas shortages, odd-even days, long lines at the fuel pump,
                              and perhaps rationing disrupt and delay normal commuting, further
                              jacking up its cost in both social and economic terms.

                              To this we can add even more pressures tending in the same direction.
                              Corporate and government employers will discover that shifting work
                              into the home—or into local or neighborhood work centers as a
                              halfway measure—can sharply reduce the huge amounts now spent
                              for real estate. The smaller the central offices and manufacturing
                              facilities become, the smaller the real estate bill, and the smaller the
                              costs of heating, cooling, lighting, policing, and maintaining them. As]]></page><page Index="163"><![CDATA[land, commercial and industrial real estate, and the associated tax load
                              all soar, the hope of reducing and/or externalizing these costs will favor
                              the farming-out of work.

                              The transfer of work and the reduction of commuting will also reduce
                              pollution and therefore the tab for cleaning it up. The more successful
                              environmentalists become at compelling companies to pay for their
                              own pollution, the more incentive there will be to shift to low-polluting
                              activities, and therefore from large-scale, centralized workplaces to
                              smaller work centers or, better yet, into the home.

                              Beyond this, as environmentalists and conservation-minded citizens
                              groups battle against the destructive effects of the auto, and oppose
                              road and highway construction, or succeed in banning cars from
                              certain districts, they unwittingly support the transfer of work. The net
                              effect of their efforts is to force up the already high cost and personal
                              inconvenience of transport as against the low cost and convenience of
                              communication.

                              When environmentalists discover the ecological disparities between
                              these two alternatives, and as the shift of work to the home begins to
                              look like a real option, they will throw their weight behind this important
                              decentralist move and help coax us into the civilization of the Third
                              Wave.

                              Social factors, too, support the move to the electronic cottage. The
                              shorter the workday becomes, the longer the commuting time in
                              relationship to it. The employee who hates to spend an hour getting to
                              and from the job in order to spend eight hours working may very well
                              refuse to invest the same

                              commuting time if the hours spent on the job are cut. The higher the
                              ratio of commuting time to working time, the more irrational, frustrating,
                              and absurd the process of shuttling back and forth. As resistance to
                              commuting rises, employers will indirectly have to increase the
                              premium paid to workers in the big, centralized work locations, as
                              against those willing to take less pay for less travel time,
                              inconvenience, and cost. Once again there will be greater incentive to
                              transfer work.

                              Finally, deep value changes are moving in the same direction. Quite
                              apart from the growth of privatism and the new allure of small-city and
                              rural life, we are witnessing a basic shift in attitude toward the family
                              unit. The nuclear family, the standard, socially approved family form
                              throughout the Second Wave period, is clearly in crisis. We shall
                              explore the family of the future in the next chapter. For now, we need
                              only note that in the United States and Europe—wherever the
                              transition out of the nuclear family is most advanced— there is a
                              swelling demand for action to glue the family unit together again. And it
                              is worth observing that one of the things that has bound families tightly
                              together through history has been shared work.]]></page><page Index="164"><![CDATA[Even today one suspects that divorce rates are lower among couples

                              home we may well see a rising demand for political measures to speed
                              up the process—tax incentives, for example, and new conceptions of
                              workers! rights.

                              During the early days of the Second Wave era, the workers' movement
                              fought for a "Ten Hour Day," a demand that would have been almost
                              incomprehensible during the First Wave period. Soon we may see the
                              rise of movements demanding that all work that can be done at home
                              be done at home. Many workers will insist on that option as a right.
                              And, to the degree that this relocation of work is seen as strengthening
                              family life, their demand will receive strong support from people of
                              many different political, religious, and cultural persuasions.

                              The fight for the electronic cottage is part of the larger super-struggle
                              between the Second Wave past and the Third Wave future, and it is
                              likely to bring together not merely

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              technologists and corporations eager to exploit the new technical
                              possibilities but a wide range of other forces—environmentalists, labor
                              reformers of a new style, and a broad coalition of organizations, from
                              conservative churches to radical feminists and mainstream political
                              groups—in support of what may well be seen as a new, more
                              satisfactory future for the family. The electronic cottage may thus
                              emerge as a key rallying point of the Third Wave forces of tomorrow.

                              THE HOME-CENTERED SOCIETY

                              If the electronic cottage were to spread, a chain of consequences of
                              great importance would flow through society. Many of these
                              consequences would please the most ardent environmentalist or
                              techno-rebel, while at the same time opening new options for business
                              entrepreneurship.

                              Community Impact: Work at home involving any sizeable fraction of the
                              population could mean greater community stability—a goal that now
                              seems beyond our reach in many high-change regions. If employees
                              can perform some or all of their work tasks at home, they do not have
                              to move every time they change jobs, as many are compelled to do
                              today. They can simply plug into a different computer.

                              This implies less forced mobility, less stress on the individual, fewer
                              transient human relationships, and greater participation in community
                              life. Today when a family moves into a community, suspecting that it
                              will be moving out again in a year or two, its members are markedly
                              reluctant to join neighborhood organizations, to make deep friendships,
                              to engage in local politics, and to commit themselves to community life
                              generally. The electronic cottage could help restore a sense of]]></page><page Index="165"><![CDATA[community belonging, and touch off a renaissance among voluntary
                              organizations like churches, women's groups, lodges, clubs, athletic
                              and youth organizations. The electronic cottage could mean more of
                              what sociologists, with their love of German jargon, call gemeinschaft.

                              Environmental Impact: The transfer of work, or any part of it, into the
                              home could not only reduce energy requirements, as suggested
                              above, but could also lead to energy decentralization. Instead of
                              requiring highly concentrated amounts of energy in a few high-rise
                              offices or sprawling factory complexes, and therefore requiring highly
                              centralized energy generation, the electronic cottage system would
                              spread

                              out energy demand and thus make it easier to use solar, wind, and
                              other alternative energy technologies. Small-scale energy generation
                              units in each home could substitute for at least some of the centralized
                              energy now required. This implies a decline in pollution as well, for two
                              reasons: first, the switch to renewable energy sources on a small-scale
                              basis eliminates the need for high-polluting fuels, and second, it means
                              smaller releases of highly concentrated pollutants that overload the
                              environment at a few critical locations.

                              Economic Impact: Some businesses would shrink in such a system,
                              and others proliferate or grow. Clearly, the electronics and computer
                              and communications industries would flourish. By contrast, the oil
                              companies, the auto industry, and commercial real estate developers
                              would be hurt. A whole new group of small-scale computer stores and
                              information services would spring up; the postal service, by contrast,
                              would shrink. Papermakers would do less well; most service industries
                              and white-collar industries would benefit.

                              At a deeper level, if individuals came to own their own electronic
                              terminals and equipment, purchased perhaps on credit, they would
                              become, in effect, independent entrepreneurs rather than classical
                              employees—meaning, as it were, increased ownership of the "means
                              of production" by the worker. We might also see groups of home-
                              workers organize themselves into small companies to contract for their
                              services or, for that matter, unite in cooperatives that jointly own the
                              machines. All sorts of new relationships and organizational forms
                              become possible.

                              Psychological Impact: The picture of a work world that is increasingly
                              dependent upon abstract symbols conjures up an overcerebral work
                              environment that is alien to us and, at one level, more impersonal than
                              at present. But at a different level, work at home suggests a deepening
                              of face-to-face and emotional relationships in both the home and the
                              neighborhood. Rather than a world of purely vicarious human
                              relationships, with an electric screen interposed between the individual
                              and the rest of humanity, as imagined in many science fiction stories,
                              one can postulate a world divided into two sets of human
                              relationships—one real, the other vicarious—with different rules and
                              roles in each.]]></page><page Index="166"><![CDATA[No doubt we will experiment with many variations and halfway

                              again. Patterns of leadership and management will have to change.
                              Small firms would undoubtedly spring up to contract for white-collar
                              tasks from larger firms and take on specialized responsibilities for
                              organizing, training, and managing teams of homeworkers. To
                              maintain adequate liaison among them, perhaps such small companies
                              will organize parties, social occasions, and other joint holidays, so that
                              the members of a team get to know one another face-to-face, not
                              merely through the console or keyboard.

                              Certainly not everyone can or will (or will want to) work at home.
                              Certainly we face a conflict over pay scales and opportunity cost. What
                              happens to the society when an increased amount of human
                              interaction on the job is vicarious while face-to-face, emotion-to-
                              emotion interaction intensifies in the home? What about cities? What
                              happens to the unemployment figures? What, in fact, do we mean by
                              the terms "employment" and "unemployment" in such a system? It
                              would be naive to dismiss such questions and problems.

                              But if there are unanswered questions and possibly painful difficulties,
                              there are also new possibilities. The leap to a new system of
                              production is likely to render irrelevant many of the most intractable
                              problems of the passing era. The misery of feudal toil, for example,
                              could not be alleviated within the system of feudal agriculture. It was
                              not eliminated by peasant revolts, by altruistic nobles, or by religious
                              Utopians. Toil remained miserable until it was altered entirely by the
                              arrival of the factory system, with its own strikingly different drawbacks.

                              In turn, the characteristic problems of industrial society— from
                              unemployment to grinding monotony on the job, to overspecialization,
                              to the callous treatment of the individual, to low wages—may, despite
                              the best intentions and promises of job enlargers, trade unions, benign
                              employers, or revolutionary workers' parties, be wholly unresolvable
                              within the framework of the Second Wave production system. If such
                              problems have remained for 300 years, under both capitalist and
                              socialist arrangements, there is cause to think they may be inherent in
                              the mode of production.

                              The leap to a new production system in both manufacturing and the
                              white-collar sector, and the possible breakthrough to the electronic
                              cottage, promise to change all the existing terms of debate, making
                              obsolete most of the issues over

                              We cannot today know if, in fact, the electronic cottage will become the
                              norm of the future. Nevertheless, it is worth recognizing that if as few
                              as 10 to 20 percent of the work force as presently defined were to
                              make this historic transfer over the next 20 to 30 years, our entire
                              economy, our cities, our ecology, our family structure, our values, and
                              even our politics would be altered almost beyond our recognition.

                              It is a possibility—a plausibility, perhaps—to be pondered.

                              It is not possible to see in relationship to one another a number of
                              Third Wave changes usually examined in isolation. We see a
                              transformation of our technological system and our energy base into a
                              new techno-sphere. This is occurring at the same time that we are de-
                              massifying the mass media and building an intelligent environment,
                              thus revolutionizing the info-sphere as well. In turn, these two giant
                              currents flow together to change the deep structure of our production
                              system, altering the nature of work in factory and office and, ultimately,
                              carrying us toward the transfer of work back into the home.

                              By themselves, such massive historical shifts would easily justify the
                              claim that we are on the edge of a new civiliza-lion. But we are
                              simultaneously restructuring our social life ns well, from our family ties
                              and friendships to our schools nnd corporations. We are about to
                              create, alongside the Third Wave techno-sphere and info-sphere, a
                              Third Wave socio-sphere as well.

                              During the Great Depression of the 1930's millions of men were thrown
                              out of work. As factory doors clanged shut against them, many plunged
                              into extremes of despair and guilt, their egos shattered by the pink
                              layoff slip.

                              Eventually unemployment came to be seen in a more sensible light—
                              not as the result of individual laziness or moral failure but of giant
                              forces outside the individual's control. The maldistribution of wealth,
                              myopic investment, runaway speculation, stupid trade policies, inept
                              government—these, not the personal weakness of laid-off workers,
                              caused unemployment. Feelings of guilt were, in most cases, naively
                              inappropriate.

                              Today, once more, egos are breaking like eggshells against the wall.
                              Now, however, the guilt is associated with the frac- ture of the family
                              rather than the economy. As millions of men and women clamber out
                              of the strewn wreckage of their marriages they, too, suffer agonies of
                              self-blame. And once more, much of the guilt is misplaced.

                              When a tiny minority is involved, the crack-up of their families may
                              reflect individual failures. But when divorce, separation, and other
                              forms of familial disaster overtake millions at once in many countries, it
                              is absurd to think the causes are purely personal.]]></page><page Index="168"><![CDATA[The fracture of the family today is, in fact, part of the general crisis of

                              traumatic process, reflected in our individual lives, that is alining the
                              family system beyond recognition.

                              Today we are told repeatedly that "the family" is falling iipart or that
                              "the family" is our Number One Problem. I'resident Jimmy Carter
                              declares, "It is clear that the national Kovernment should have a pro-
                              family policy. . . . There can in- no more urgent priority." Substitute
                              preachers, prime min-isiers, or the press, and the pious rhetoric comes
                              out very much the same. When they speak of "the family," however,
                              ilicy typically do not mean the family in all its luxuriant variety of
                              possible forms, but one particular type of family: the Second Wave
                              family.

                              What they usually have in mind is a husband-breadwinner, n wife-
                              housekeeper, and a number of small children. While many other family
                              types exist, it was this particular family form—the nuclear family—that
                              Second Wave civilization idealized, made dominant, and spread
                              around the world.

                              This type of family became the standard, socially approved model
                              because its structure perfectly fitted the needs of a mass-production
                              society with widely shared values and life-Niyles, hierarchical,
                              bureaucratic power, and a clear separation of home life from work life
                              hi the marketplace.

                              Today, when the authorities urge us to "restore" the family it is this
                              Second Wave nuclear family they usually have hi mind. By thinking so
                              narrowly they not only misdiagnose the entire problem, they reveal a
                              childish naivete about what Nil ps would actually be required to restore
                              the nuclear family to its former importance.

                              Thus the authorities frantically blame the family crisis on everything
                              from "smut peddlers" to rock music. Some tell us dial opposing
                              abortion or wiping out sex education or resist-mi' feminism will glue the
                              family back together again. Or 11 iey urge courses in "family
                              education." The chief United Males government statistician on family
                              matters wants "more rllective training" to teach people how to marry
                              more wisely, «>i else a "scientifically tested and appealing system for
                              select-iiii- a marriage partner." What we need, say others, are more
                              marriage counselors or even more public relations to give the i innly a
                              better image! Blind to the ways in which historical I wuvcs of change
                              influence us, they come up with well-inten-i M 'iied, often inane
                              proposals that utterly miss the target.

                              If we really want to restore the nuclear family to its former dominance,
                              there are things we could do. Here are a few:

                              1) Freeze all technology in its Second Wave stage to maintain a
                              factory-based, mass-production society. Begin by smashing the
                              computer. The computer is a greater threat to the Second Wave family
                              than all the abortion laws and gay rights movements and pornography
                              in the world, for the nuclear family needs the mass-production system
                              to retain ite dominance, and the computer is moving us beyond mass
                              pro* duction.

                              2) Subsidize manufacture and block the rise of the service sector in the
                              economy. White-collar, professional, and technical workers are less
                              traditional, less family-oriented, more intellectually and psychologically
                              mobile than blue-collar workers. Divorce rates have risen along with
                              the rise service occupations.

                              3) "Solve" the energy crisis by applying nuclear and other highly
                              centralized energy processes. The nuclear family fits better in a
                              centralized than a decentralized society, and energy systems heavily
                              affect the degree of social and political centralization.

                              4) Ban the increasingly de-massified media, beginning with cable
                              television and cassette, but not overlooking local a regional
                              magazines. Nuclear families work best where there is a national
                              consensus on information and values, not in a society based on high
                              diversity. While some critics naively attack the media for allegedly
                              undermining the family, it was the mass media that idealized the
                              nuclear family form hi the first place.

                              5) Forcibly drive women back into the kitchen. Reduce the wages of
                              women to the absolute minimum. Strengthen, rather than relax, all
                              union seniority provisions to assure that women are further
                              disadvantaged in the labor force. The m* clear family has no nucleus
                              when there are no adults left ai home. (One could, of course, achieve
                              the same effect by reversing matters, permitting women to work while
                              compellin| men to stay home and rear the children.)

                              6) Simultaneously slash the wages of young workers tc make them
                              more dependent, for a longer time, on thei] families—and thus less
                              psychologically independent. The nu-

                              7) Ban contraception and research into reproductive biology. These
                              make for the independence of women and for ex-ii ,imarital sex, a

                              lead toward diversity, freedom of movement and ideas, or individuality.
                              The nuclear family remains

                              In short, this is what a pro-family policy would have to be II we insist on
                              defining family as nuclear. If we truly wish to it-store the Second Wave
                              family, we had better be prepared lo restore Second Wave civilization
                              as a whole—to freeze not only technology but history itself.

                              For what we are witnessing is not the death of the family us such, but
                              the final fracture of the Second Wave family sys-feni in which all
                              families were supposed to emulate the ideal-i/ed nuclear model, and
                              the emergence in its place of a iliversity of family forms. Just as we are
                              de-massif ying our media and our production, we are de-massifying the
                              family NY stem in the transition to a Third Wave civilization.

                              NON-NUCLEAR. LIFE-STYLES

                              The coming of the Third Wave, of course, does not mean i IK; end of
                              the nuclear family any more than the coming of flu; vSecond Wave
                              meant the end of the extended family. It means, rather, that the nuclear
                              family can no longer serve as UK- ideal model for society.

                              The little-appreciated fact is that, at least in the United Slates where
                              the Third Wave is most advanced, most people already live outside the
                              classical nuclear family form.

                              If we define the nuclear family as a working husband, a housekeeping
                              wife, and two children, and ask how many Americans actually still live
                              in this type of family, the answer i'i astonishing: 7 percent of the total

                              tion. Ninety-three percent of the population do not fit this ideal Second
                              Wave model any longer.

                              Even if we broaden our definition to include families in which both
                              spouses work or in which there are fewer or more than two children,
                              we find the vast majority—as many as two thirds to three quarters of
                              the population—living outside the nuclear situation. Moreover, all the
                              evidence suggests that nuclear households (however we choose to
                              define them) are still shrinking in number as other family forms rapidly
                              multiply.]]></page><page Index="171"><![CDATA[To begin with, we are witnessing a population explosion of "solos"—
                              people who live alone, outside a family altogether. Between 1970 and
                              1978 the number of persons aged fourteen to thirty-four who lived
                              alone nearly tripled in the United States—rising from 1.5 million to 4.3
                              million. Today, a fifth of all households in the United States consists of
                              a person living solo. Nor are all these people losers or loners, forced
                              into the solo life. Many deliberately choose it, at least for a time. Says a
                              legislative aide to a Seattle councilwoman, "I would consider marriage
                              if the right person came along, but I would not give up my career for it."
                              In the meantime she lives alone. She is part of a large class of young
                              adults who are leaving home earlier but marrying later, thus creating
                              what census specialist Arthur Norton says is a "transitional living
                              phase" that is "becoming an acceptable part of one's life cycle.'*

                              Looking at an older slice of the population, we find a large number of
                              formerly married people, often "between mar-* riages," living on their
                              own and, in many cases, decidedly liking it. The growth of such groups
                              has created a nourishing "singles" culture and a much publicized
                              proliferation of bars; ski lodges, travel tours, and other services or
                              product$ designed for the independent individual. Simultaneously, the
                              real estate industry has come up with "singles only" condo-minia, and
                              has begun to respond to a need for smaller apartments and suburban
                              homes with fewer bedrooms. Almost a fifth of all home buyers in the
                              United States today are single.

                              We are also experiencing a headlong growth in the number of people
                              living together without bothering about legal formalities. This group has
                              more than doubled in the past decade, according to United States
                              authorities. The practice has become so common that the United
                              States Department of Housing and Urban Development has
                              overthrown tradition and changed its rules to permit such couples to
                              occupy public housing. The courts, meanwhile, from Connecticut to

                              has sprouted as a new professional service alongside marriage
                              counseling.

                              THE CHILD-FREE CULTURE

                              Another significant change has been the growth in the number of those
                              consciously choosing what is coming to be known as a "child-free" life-
                              style. According to James Ramey, senior research associate at the
                              Center for Policy Research, we are seeing a massive shift from "child-
                              centered" to "adult-centered" homes. At the turn of the century there
                              were few singles in society, and relatively few parents lived very long
                              after their youngest child left the home. Thus most households were, in
                              fact, child-centered. By contrast, as early as 1970 in the United States
                              only one in three adults lived in a home with children under eighteen.]]></page><page Index="172"><![CDATA[Today organizations are springing up to promote the child-free life, and
                              a reluctance to have children is spreading in many industrial nations. In
                              1960 only 20 percent of "ever-married" American women under age
                              thirty were child-free. By 1975 this had shot up to 32 percent—a 60
                              percent jump in fifteen years. A vocal organization, the National
                              Alliance for Optional Parenthood, has arisen to protect the rights of the
                              childless and to combat pronatalist propaganda.

                              A similar organization, the National Association for the Childless, has
                              sprouted in Britain, and many couples across Europe are also
                              deliberately choosing to remain childless. In Bonn, West Germany, for
                              example, Theo and Agnes Rohl, both in their mid-thirties, he a city
                              official, she a secretary, say, "We don't think well have children . . ."
                              The Rohls are modestly affluent. They own a small home. They
                              manage a vacation trip to California or Southern France now and then.
                              Children would drastically alter their way of life. "We're used to our life-
                              style the way it is," they say, "and we like being independent." Nor is
                              this reluctance to bear children a sign of capitalist decadence. Ijt is
                              present in the Soviet Union, too, where many young Russian couples
                              echo the sentiments of the Rohls and explicitly reject parenthood—a
                              fact that worries Soviet officialdom in view of the still-high birth rates
                              among several non-Russian national minorities.

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              Turning now to those with children, the breakdown of the nuclear
                              family is even more sharply evidenced in the spectacular increase in
                              single-parent families. So many divorces, breakups, and separations
                              have occurred in recent years— mainly in nuclear families—that today
                              a staggering one-in-seven American children is raised by a single
                              parent, and the number is even higher—one in four—in urban areas.*

                              The increase in such households has brought a growing recognition
                              that, despite severe problems, a one-parent household can, under
                              certain circumstances, be better for the child than a nuclear household
                              continually torn by bitter strife. Newspapers and organizations now
                              serve single parents and are heightening their group consciousness
                              and political clout.

                              Nor, once again, is the phenomenon purely American. In Britain today
                              nearly one family in ten is headed by a single parent—nearly a sixth of
                              them headed by men—and one-parent households form what New
                              Society magazine calls "the fastest growing group in poverty." A
                              London-based organization, the National Council for One-Parent
                              Families, has sprung up to champion their cause.

                              In Germany, a housing association in Cologne has constructed a
                              special block of apartments for such families and provided them with
                              day-time child care so the parents can work. And in Scandinavia a
                              network of special welfare rights has grown up to support these
                              families. The Swedes, for example, give one-parent households first
                              crack at nursery and day-care facilities. In both Norway and Sweden,
                              in fact, it is sometimes possible for a single-parent family to enjoy a
                              higher standard of living than that of the typical nuclear family.]]></page><page Index="173"><![CDATA[A challenging new form of family has arisen in the meantime that
                              reflects the high rate of remarriage after divorce. In Future Shock I
                              identified this as the "aggregate family," in which two divorced couples
                              with children remarry, bringing the children of both marriages (and the
                              adults as well) into a new, expanded family form. It is now estimated
                              that 25 percent of American children are, or will soon be, members of
                              such family units. According to Davidyne Mayleas, such units, with
                              their "poly-parents," may be the mainstream family form of tomorrow.
                              "We're into economic polygamy," says Mayleas—meaning that the two
                              merged family units



                              * The total is also fed by out-of-wedlock births and by adoptions by
                              single women and (increasingly) single men.

                              FAMILIES OF THE FUTURE

                              typically transfer money back and forth in the form of child support or
                              other payments. The spread of this family form, she reports, has been
                              accompanied by a rising incidence of sexual relations between parents
                              and nonblood-related children.

                              The technologically advanced nations today are honeycombed with a
                              bewildering array of family forms: Homosexual marriages, communes,
                              groups of elderly people banding together to share expenses (and
                              sometimes sex), tribal groupings among certain ethnic minorities, and
                              many other forms coexist as never before. There are contract
                              marriages, serial marriages, family clusters, and a variety of intimate
                              networks with or without shared sex, as well as families in which
                              mother and father live and work in two different cities.

                              Even these family forms barely hint at the even richer variety bubbling
                              under the surface. When three psychiatrists— Kellam, Ensminger, and
                              Turner—attempted to map the "variations of families" found in a single
                              poor black neighborhood in Chicago, they identified "no less than 86
                              different combinations of adults," including numerous forms of "mother-
                              grandmother" families, "mother-aunt" families, "mother-stepfather
                              families," and "mother-other" families.

                              Faced with this veritable maze of kinship arrangements, even fairly
                              orthodox scholars have come around to the once radical view that we
                              are moving out of the age of the nuclear family and into a new society
                              marked by diversity hi family life. In the words of sociologist Jessie
                              Bernard, "The most characteristic aspect of marriage in the future will
                              be precisely the array of options available to different people who want
                              different things from their relationships with one another."

                              The frequently asked question, "What is the future of the family?"
                              usually implies that as the Second Wave nuclear family loses its
                              dominance some other form will replace it. A more likely outcome is
                              that during Third Wave civilization no single form will dominate the
                              family mix for any long period. Instead we will see a high variety of]]></page><page Index="174"><![CDATA[family structures. Rather than masses of people living in uniform family
                              arrangements, we shall see people moving through this system,
                              tracing personalized or-"customized" trajectories during the course of
                              their lives.

                              Again, this does not mean the total elimination or "death" of the nuclear
                              family. It merely means that from now on the nuclear family will be only
                              one of the many socially accepted

                              and approved forms. As the Third Wave sweeps in, the family system
                              is becoming de-massified right along with the production system and
                              the information system in society.

                              "HOT" RELATIONSHIPS

                              Given this flowering of a multiplicity of family forms, it is too early to tell
                              which will emerge as significant styles in a Third Wave civilization.

                              Will our children live alone for many years, perhaps decades? Will they
                              go childless? Will we retire into old-age communes? What about more
                              exotic possibilities? Families wit several husbands and one wife? (That
                              could happen if genetic tinkering lets us preselect the sex of our
                              children, and too many parents choose boys.) What about homosexual
                              families raising children? The courts are already debating this issue.
                              What about the potential impact of cloning?

                              If each of us moves through a trajectory of family experiences in our
                              lives, what will the phases be? A trial marriage, followed by a dual-
                              career marriage with no children, then a homosexual marriage with
                              children? The possible permutations are endless. Nor, despite the
                              cries of outrage, should any of these be regarded as unthinkable. As
                              Jessie Bernard has put it, "There is literally nothing about marriage
                              that' anyone can imagine that has not in fact taken place. . . . All these
                              variations seeemed quite natural to those who lived with them."

                              Which specific family forms vanish and which ones proliferate will
                              depend less on pulpit-pounding about the "sanctity, of the family" than
                              on the decisions we make with respect to i technology and work. While
                              many forces influence family structure—communication patterns,
                              values, demographic changes, religious movements, even ecological
                              shifts—the linkage between family form and work arrangements is
                              particularly strong. Thus, just as the nuclear family was pro-moted by
                              the rise of the factory and office work, any shift away from the factory
                              and office would also exert a heavy in-fluence on the family.

                              It is impossible, in the space of a single chapter, to spell out all the
                              ways in which the coming changes in the labor force and in the nature
                              of work will alter family life. But one change is so potentially
                              revolutionary, and so alien to our ex-perience, it needs far more
                              attention than it has received so

                              far. This is, of course, the shift of work out of the office and factory and
                              back into the home.

                              Assume for a moment that twenty-five years from now 15 percent of
                              the work force is employed part- or full-time in the home. How would
                              working at home change the quality of our personal relationships or the
                              meaning of love? What would life be like in the electronic cottage?

                              Whether the work-at-home task is programming a computer, writing a
                              pamphlet, monitoring distant manufacturing processes, designing a
                              building, or typing electronic correspondence, one immediate change
                              is clear. Relocating work into the home means that many spouses who
                              now see each other only a limited number of hours each day would be
                              thrown together more intimately. Some, no doubt, would find this
                              prolonged proximity hateful. Many others, however, would find then*
                              marriages saved and their relationships much enriched through shared
                              experience.

                              Let us visit several electronic cottages to see how people might adapt
                              to so fundamental a change in society. Such a tour would no doubt
                              reveal a wide diversity of living and working arrangements.

                              In some houses, perhaps the majority, we might well find couples
                              dividing things up more or less conventionally, with one person doing
                              the "job-work" while the other keeps house—he, perhaps, writing
                              programs while she looks after the kids. The very presence of work hi
                              the home, however, would probably encourage a sharing of both job-
                              work and housekeeping. We would find many homes, therefore, in
                              which man and wife split a single full-tune job. For example, we might
                              find both husband and wife taking turns at monitoring a complex
                              manufacturing process on the console screen in the den, four hours
                              on, four hours off.

                              Down the street, by contrast, we would likely discover a couple holding
                              not one, but two quite different jobs, with each spouse working
                              separately. A cellular physiologist and a CPA might each work at his or
                              her craft. Even here, however, with the jobs differing sharply hi
                              character, there is still likely to be some sharing of problems, some

                              conversation relating to work. It is almost impossible under such
                              conditions for the work life of an individual to be strictly segregated
                              from personal life. By the same token, it is next to impossible to freeze
                              one's mate out of a whole dimension of one's existence.

                              Right next door (continuing our survey) we could well come upon a
                              couple holding two different jobs but sharing both, the husband

                              more interesting, work for both.

                              In such homes, whether one or several jobs are shared, each partner
                              necessarily learns from the other, participates in the problem-solving,
                              engages in complex give-and-take, all of which cannot help but deepen
                              intimacy. Forced proximity, it goes without saying, does not guarantee
                              happiness. The extended family units of the First Wave era, which
                              were also economic production units, were hardly models of
                              interpersonal sensitivity and mutual psychological support. Such
                              families had their own problems and stresses. But there were few
                              uncommitted or "cooled out" relationships. Working together assured, if
                              nothing else, tight, complex, "hot" personal relationships—a
                              committedness many people envy today.

                              In short, the spread of work-at-home on a large scale could not only
                              affect family structure but transform relationships within the family. It
                              could, to put it simply, provide a common set of experiences and get
                              marriage partners talking to one another again. It could shift their
                              relationships along the spectrum from "cool" to "hot." It could also
                              redefine love itself and bring with it the concept of Love Plus.

                              LOVE PLUS

                              We saw how, as the Second Wave progressed, the family unit
                              transferred many of its functions to other institutions— education to the
                              school, care of the ill to hospitals, and so on. This progressive stripping
                              away of the functions of the family unit was accompanied by the rise of
                              romantic love.

                              A First Wave person looking for a mate might properly have asked "Is
                              my proposed spouse a good worker? A good healer? A good teacher
                              for the children to come? Can we work together compatibly? Will she
                              (or he) carry a full load or prove to be a shirker?" Peasant families
                              actually asked "Is she strong, good at bending and lifting, or is she
                              sickly and weak?"

                              As the functions of the family were hived off during the Second Wave
                              era, those questions changed. The family was

                              no longer a combination of production team, school, field hospital, and
                              nursing home. Instead, its psychological functions became more
                              important. Marriage was supposed to supply companionship, sex,
                              warmth, and support. Soon this shift in the functions of the family was
                              reflected in new criteria for choosing a mate. They were summed up in
                              the single word love. It was love, the popular culture assured us, that
                              makes the world go round.

                              Of course, real life seldom lived up to romantic fiction. Class, social
                              status, and income continued to play a role in the choice of a mate. But
                              all such considerations were supposed to be secondary to Love with a

                              are likely to take more into consideration than simple sexual and
                              psychological gratification—or social status, for that matter. They may
                              begin to insist on Love Plus—sexual and psychological gratification
                              plus brains (as then- grandfathers once favored brawn), love plus
                              conscientiousness, responsibility, self-discipline, or other work-related
                              virtues. We may—who knows?—hear some John Denver of the future
                              croon lyrics like:

                              I love your eyes, your cherry lips, the love that always lingers, your way
                              with words and random blips, your skilled computer fingers.

                              More seriously, one can imagine at least some families of the future
                              taking on additional functions rather than shedding them, and serving
                              as a multipurpose, rather than a narrowly specialized, social unit. With
                              such a change the criteria for marriage, the very definition of love
                              would be transformed.

                              Children, meanwhile, would also be likely to grow up differently in the

                              see work taking place. First Wave children, from then: first blink of
                              consciousness, saw their parents at work. Second Wave children, by

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              vorced from real work life. Most today have only the foggiest notion of
                              what their parents do or how they live while at work. One possibly
                              apocryphal story makes the point: An executive decides to bring his
                              son to his office one day and to take him out to lunch. The boy sees
                              the plushly carpeted office, the indirect lighting, the elegant reception
                              room. He sees the fancy expense-account restaurant with its
                              obsequious waiters and exorbitant prices. Finally, picturing their home
                              and unable to restrain himself, the boy blurts out: "Daddy, how come
                              you're so rich and we're so poor?"

                              The fact is that children today—especially affluent children—are totally
                              divorced from one of the most important dimensions of their parents'
                              lives. In an electronic cottage kids not only observe work, they may,
                              after a certain age, engage in it themselves. Second Wave restrictions
                              on child labor—originally well-intentioned and necessary, but now
                              largely an anachronistic device to keep young people out of the
                              crowded job market—become more difficult to enforce in the home
                              setting. Certain forms of work, indeed, might be specifically designed
                              for youngsters and even integrated with their education. (Anyone who
                              underestimates the capacity of even very young people to understand

                              The alienation of youth today flows in large measure from being forced
                              to accept a nonproductive role in society during an endlessly prolonged
                              adolescence. The electronic cottage would counteract this situation.

                              In fact, integrating young people into work in the electronic cottage
                              may offer the only real solution to the problems of high youth
                              unemployment. This problem will grow increasingly explosive in many
                              countries .in the years ahead, with all the attendant evils of juvenile
                              crime, violence, and psychological immiseration, and cannot be solved
                              within the framework of a Second Wave economy except by totalitarian
                              means—drafting young people, for example, for war or forced service.
                              The electronic cottage opens an alternative way to bring youth back
                              into socially and economically productive roles, and we may see,
                              before long, political campaigns for, rather than against, child labor,
                              along with struggles over the necessary measures to protect them
                              against gross economic exploitation.

                              THE ELECTRONIC EXPANDED FAMILY

                              Beyond this, one can easily imagine the work-at-home household
                              becoming something radically different: an "electronic expanded
                              family."

                              Perhaps the most common family form in First Wave societies was the
                              so-called extended family, which brought several generations together
                              under the same roof. There were also "expanded families" which, in
                              addition to the core members, included an unrelated orphan or two, an
                              apprentice or additional farm hand, or others. One can likewise picture
                              the work-at-home family of tomorrow inviting an outsider or two to join
                              it—for example, a colleague from the husband's or wife's firm, or
                              perhaps a customer or supplier engaged in related work, or, for that
                              matter, a neighbor's child who wants to learn the trade. One can
                              foresee the legal incorporation of such a family as a small business
                              under special laws designed to foster the cornmune-cum-corporation
                              or the cooperative. For many the household would become an
                              electronic expanded family.

                              It is true that most of the communes formed in the 1960's and 1970's
                              fell rapidly apart, seeming to suggest that communes, as such, are
                              inherently unstable in high-technology societies. A closer look reveals,
                              however, that the ones that disintegrated most rapidly Were those
                              organized primarily for psychological purposes—to promote
                              interpersonal sensitivity, to combat loneliness, to provide intimacy, or
                              the like. Most had no economic base and saw themselves as Utopian
                              experiments. The communes that have succeeded over time—and
                              some have—are, by contrast, those that have had a clear external
                              mission, an economic base, and a practical, rather than purely
                              Utopian, outlook.

                              An external mission welds a group together. It may, indeed, provide
                              the necessary economic base. If this external mission is to design a]]></page><page Index="179"><![CDATA[new product, to handle the "electronic paper work" for a hospital, to do

                              designed as a rebuke to everyone else's life-style or for demonstration
                              purposes but rather as an integral part of the

                              main wiring of the economic system, the chances for their survival
                              would be sharply improved. Indeed, we may find expanded households
                              linking up to form networks. Such networks of expanded families could
                              supply some needed business or social service, cooperating to market
                              their work or setting up their own version of a trade association to
                              represent them. Internally, they might or might not share sex across
                              marriage lines. They might or might not be heterosexual. They might
                              be childless or child-ful.

                              In brief, what we see is the possible resurrection of the expanded
                              family. Today some 6 percent of American adults live in ordinary
                              extended families. One might easily imagine a doubling or tripling of
                              this number in the next generation, with some units expanding to
                              include outsiders. This would be no trivial event but a movement
                              involving millions in the United States alone. For community life, for
                              patterns of love and marriage, for the reconstitution of friendship
                              networks, for the economy and the consumer marketplace, as well as
                              for our psyches and personality structure, the rise of the electronic
                              expanded family would be momentous.

                              This new version of the extended family is not presented here as
                              inevitable, not as better or worse than some other type of family, but
                              simply as one example of the many new family forms likely to find
                              viable niches in the complex social ecology of tomorrow.

                              PARENTAL MALPRACTICE

                              This rich diversity of family forms won't come into being without pain
                              and anguish. For any change in family structure also forces change hi
                              the roles we live. Every society, through its institutions, creates its own
                              architecture of roles or social expectations. The corporation and trade
                              union between them more or less defined what was expected of
                              workers and bosses. Schools fixed the respective roles of teachers
                              and pupils. And the Second Wave family allocated the roles of
                              breadwinner, housekeeper, and child. As the nuclear family goes
                              critical, so to speak, the roles associated with it begin to shiver and
                              crack—with excruciating personal impact.

                              From the day that Betty Friedan's bombshell book, The Feminine
                              Mystique, launched the modern feminist movement in many nations,
                              we have seen a painful struggle to redefine the roles of men and

                              nuclear-family future. The expectations and the behavior of both sexes
                              have shifted with respect to jobs, legal and financial rights, household
                              responsibilities, and even sexual performance. "Now," writes Peter
                              Knobler, editor of Crawdaddy, a rock music magazine, "a guy's got to
                              contend with women breaking all the rules. . . . Many regulations need
                              breaking," he adds, "but that doesn't make it much easier."

                              Roles are shaken by the battle over abortion, for instance, as women
                              insist that they—not politicians, not priests, not doctors or even
                              husbands—have a right to control their bodies. Sexual roles are further
                              blurred as homosexuals demand and partially win "gay rights." Even
                              the role of the child in society is changing. Suddenly advocates spring
                              up to lobby for a Children's Bill of Rights.

                              Courts are swamped by cases involving role redefinition, as
                              alternatives to the nuclear family multiply and gain acceptability. Do
                              unmarried spouses have to share their property after they break up?
                              Can a couple legally pay a woman to bear a child for them by artificial
                              insemination? (A British court said no—but for how long?) Can a
                              lesbian be a "good mother" and retain custody of her child after a
                              divorce? (An American court says yes.) What is meant by being a good
                              parent? Nothing underlines the changing role structure more than the
                              lawsuit filed in Boulder, Colorado, by an angry twenty-four-year-old
                              named Tom Hansen. Parents can make mistakes, Hansen's lawyers
                              argued, but they must be held legally—and financially—responsible for
                              the results. Thus Han-sen's court action claimed $350,000 hi damages
                              on an unprecedented legal ground: parental malpractice.

                              EASING INTO TOMORROW

                              Behind all this confusion and turmoil, a new Third Wave family system
                              is coalescing, based on a diversity of family forms and more varied
                              individual roles. This de-massification of the family opens many new
                              personal options. Third Wave civilization will not try to stuff everyone
                              willy-nilly into a single family form. For this reason the emergent family
                              system could free each of us to find his or her own niche, to select or
                              create a family style or trajectory attuned to individualized needs.

                              But before anyone can perform a celebratory dance, the

                              agonies of transition must be dealt with. Caught in the crack-up of the
                              old, with the new system not yet in place, millions find the higher level
                              of diversity bewildering rather than helpful. Instead of being liberated,
                              they suffer from overchoice and are wounded, embittered, plunged into
                              a sorrow and loneliness intensified by the very multiplicity of their
                              options.]]></page><page Index="181"><![CDATA[To make the new diversity work for us instead of against us, we will
                              need changes on many levels at once, from morality and taxes to
                              employment practices.

                              In the field of values we need to begin removing the unwarranted guilt
                              that accompanies the breakup and restructuring of families. Instead of
                              exacerbating unjustified guilt, the media, the church, the courts, and
                              the political system should be working to lower the guilt level.

                              The decision to live outside a nuclear family framework should be
                              made easier, not harder. Values change more slowly, as a rule, than
                              social reality. Thus we have not yet developed the ethic of tolerance for
                              diversity that a de-massified society will both require and engender.
                              Raised under Second Wave conditions, firmly taught that one kind of
                              family is "normal" and others somehow suspect, if not "deviant," vast
                              numbers remain intolerant of the new variety hi family styles. Until that
                              changes, the pain of transition will remain unnecessarily high.

                              In economic and social life, individuals cannot enjoy the benefits of
                              widened family options so long as laws, tax codes, welfare practices,
                              school arrangements, housing codes, and even architectural forms all
                              remain implicitly biased toward the Second Wave family. They take
                              little account of the special needs of women who work, of men who
                              stay home to take care of their children, of bachelors and "spinsters"
                              (hateful term!), or of between-marrieds, or "aggregate families," or
                              widows living alone or together. All such groupings have been subtly or
                              openly discriminated against in Second Wave societies.

                              Even while it piously praised housekeeping, Second Wave civilization
                              denied dignity to the person performing that task. Housekeeping is
                              productive, indeed crucial, work, and needs to be recognized as part of
                              the economy. To assure the enhanced status of housekeeping,
                              whether done by women or by men, by individuals or by groups
                              working together, we will have to pay wages or impute economic value
                              to it.

                              In the out-of-the-home economy, employment practices in

                              many places still are based on the obsolete assumption that (he man is
                              the primary breadwinner and the wife a supplemental, expendable
                              earner, instead of a fully independent participant in the labor market.
                              By easing seniority requirements, by spreading flextime, by opening
                              part-time opportunities, we not only humanize production, we adapt it
                              to the needs of a multistyle family system. Today there are many
                              indications that the work system is beginning to accommodate itself to
                              the new diversity of family arrangements. Shortly after Citibank, one of
                              the largest banks in the United States, began to promote women to
                              managerial jobs, it found that its male executives were marrying their
                              new colleagues. The bank had a long-standing rule barring the
                              employment of couples. It had to change that rule. According to
                              Business Week, the "company couple" is now flourishing with benefits
                              both for company and for family life.]]></page><page Index="182"><![CDATA[It is likely that before long we will go far beyond such minor
                              adaptations. We may see demands not merely for the hiring of
                              "company couples" but of whole families to work together as a
                              production team. Because this was inefficient hi the Second Wave
                              factory doesn't mean it is necessarily inappropriate today. No one
                              knows how such policies would work out but, as in other family
                              matters, we ought to encourage, perhaps even publicly fund, small-
                              scale experiments.

                              Such measures could help us ease our way into tomorrow, minimizing
                              for millions the pain of transition. But whether painful or not, a new
                              family system is emergying to supplant the one that characterized the
                              Second Wave past. This new family system will be a core institution in
                              the novel socio-sphere taking shape alongside the new techno-sphere
                              and info-sphere. It is part of the act of social creation by which our
                              generation is adapting to and constructing a new civilization.

                              The big corporation was the characteristic business organiza tion of
                              the industrial era. Today several thousand such behe moths, both
                              private and public, bestride the earth, producing a large proportion of
                              all the goods and services we buy.

                              Seen from the outside they present a commanding appar-ance. They
                              control vast resources, employ millions of workers, and they deeply
                              influence not merely our economies but our political affairs as well.
                              Their computers and corporate jets, their unmatched ability to plan, to
                              invest, to execute projects on a grand scale, make them seem
                              unshakably powerful and permanent. At a time when most of us feel
                              powerless, they appear to dominate our destinies.

                              Yet that is not the way they look from the inside, to the men (and a few
                              women) who run these organizations. Indeed, many of our top
                              managers today feel quite as frustrated and powerless as the rest of
                              us. For exactly like the nuclear family, the school, the mass media, and
                              the other key institutions of the industrial age, the corporation is being
                              hurled about, shaken and transformed by the Third Wave of change.
                              And a good many top managers do not know what has hit them.

                              The most immediate change affecting the corporation is the crisis in
                              the world economy. For three hundred years Second Wave civilization
                              worked to create an integrated global marketplace. Periodically these
                              efforts were set back by wars, 226

                              recovered, emerging larger and more closely integrated than before.

                              Today a new crisis has struck. But this one is different. Unlike all
                              previous crises during the industrial era, it involves not only money but
                              the entire energy base of the society. Unlike the crises of the past, it
                              brings inflation and unemployment simultaneously, not sequentially.
                              Unlike those of the past, it is directly linked to fundamental ecological
                              problems, to an entirely new species of technology, and to the
                              introduction of a new level of communications into the production
                              system. Finally, it is not, as Marxists claim, a crisis of capitalism alone,
                              but one that involves the socialist industrial nations as well. It is, in
                              short, the general crisis of industrial civilization as a whole.

                              The upheaval in the world economy threatens the survival of the
                              corporation as we know it, throwing its managers into a wholly
                              unfamiliar environment. Thus from the end of World War II until the
                              early 1970's the corporation functioned in a comparatively stable
                              environment. Growth was the key word. The dollar was king.
                              Currencies remained stable for long periods. The postwar financial
                              structure laid in place at Bretton Woods by the capitalist industrial
                              powers, and the COMECON system created by the Soviets, seemed
                              solid. The escalator to affluence was still ascending, and economists
                              were so confident of their ability to predict and control the economic
                              machine that they spoke casually about "fine tuning" it.

                              Today the phrase evokes only derisive snorts. The President
                              wisecracks that he knows a Georgia fortune-teller who is a -better
                              forecaster than the economists. A former Secretary of the Treasury, W.
                              Michael Blumenthal, says that "the economics profession is close to
                              bankruptcy in understanding the present situation—before or after the
                              fact" Standing in the tangled wreckage of economic theory and the
                              rubble of the postwar economic infrastructure, corporate decision-
                              makers face rising uncertainties.

                              Interest rates zigzag. Currencies gyrate. Central banks buy and sell
                              money by the carload to damp the swings, but the gyrations only grow
                              more extreme. The dollar and the yen perform a Kabuki dance, the
                              Europeans promote their own new currency (quaintly named the
                              "ecu"), while Arabs frantically off-load billions of dollars worth of
                              American paper. Gold prices break all records.


                              228 THE THIRD WAVE

                              While all of this is occurring, technology and communications
                              restructure world markets, making transnational production both
                              possible and necessary. And to facilitate such operations, a jet-age
                              money system is taking form. A global electronic banking network—
                              impossible before the computer and satellite—now instantaneously
                              links Hong Kong, Manila, or Singapore with the Bahamas, the Cayman
                              Islands, and New York.

                              government—which threatens to blow up in everyone's face.

                              The bulk of this stateless currency consists of Eurodollars—dollars
                              outside the United States. In 1975, writing about the accelerated
                              growth of Eurodollars, I warned that this new currency was a wild card
                              in the economic game. "Here the 'Euros' contribute to inflation, there
                              they shift the balance of payments, in another place they undermine
                              the currency—as they stampede from place to place" across na- :
                              tional boundaries. At that time there were an estimated 180 j billion
                              such Eurodollars.

                              By 1978 a panicky Business Week was reporting on "the , incredible
                              state" of the international finance system and the 180 billion had
                              mushroomed into some 400 billion dollars worth of Eurodollars,
                              Euromarks, Eurofrancs, Euroguilders, and Euroyen. Bankers dealing
                              with the supranational cur- : rency were free to issue unlimited credit
                              and—not being required to hold any cash reserves—were able to lend
                              out at bargain-basement rates. Today's estimates put the Eurocurrency
                              total as high as a trillion dollars.

                              The Second Wave economic system in which the corporation grew up
                              was based on national markets, national I currencies, and national
                              governments. This nation-based infra- j structure, however, is utterly
                              unable to regulate or contain the new transnational and electronic
                              "Eurobubble." The structures designed for a Second Wave world are
                              no longer adequate.

                              Indeed, the entire global framework that stabilized world trade relations
                              for the giant corporations is rattling and in danger of coming apart. The
                              World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the General
                              Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are all under heavy attack. Europeans

                              THE CORPORATE IDENTITY CRISIS

                              together a new structure to be controlled by them. The "less developed
                              countries" on one side, and the Arabs brandishing their petrodollars on
                              the other, clamor for influence in the financial system of tomorrow and
                              speak of creating their own counterparts to the IMF. The dollar is
                              dethroned, and jerks and spasms rip through the world economy.

                              All this is compounded by erratic shortages and gluts of energy and
                              resources; by rapid changes in the attitudes of consumers, workers,
                              and managers; by rapidly shifting imbalances of trade; and above all
                              by the rising militancy of the non-industrial world.

                              This is the volatile, confusing environment in which today's
                              corporations struggle to operate. The managers who run them have no
                              wish to relinquish corporate power. They will battle for profits,
                              production, and personal advancement. But faced with soaring levels
                              of unpredictability, with mounting public criticism and hostile political
                              pressures, our most intelligent managers are questioning the goals,
                              structure, responsibility, the very raison d'etre of their organizations.]]></page><page Index="185"><![CDATA[Many of our biggest corporations are experiencing something
                              analogous to an identity crisis as they watch the once stable Second
                              Wave framework disintegrate around them.

                              THE ACCELERATIVE ECONOMY

                              This corporate identity crisis is intensified by the speed at which events
                              are moving. For the very speed of change introduces a new element
                              into management, forcing executives, already nervous in an unfamiliar
                              environment, to make more and more decisions at a faster and faster
                              pace. Response times are honed to a minimum.

                              At the financial level the speed of transactions is accelerating as banks
                              and other financial institutions computerize. Some banks even relocate
                              geographically to take advantage of time zone differences. Says
                              Euromoney, the international bankers' journal, "Time zones can be
                              used as a competitive edge."

                              In this hotted-up environment, the big corporations are driven almost
                              willy-nilly to invest and borrow in various currencies not on an annual,
                              a ninety-day, or even a seven-day basis, but literally on an overnight or
                              minute-to-minute basis. A new corporate officer has appeared in the
                              executive suite—the "international cash manager," who remains

                              230

                              plugged into the worldwide electronic casino twenty-four hours a day,
                              searching for the lowest interest rates, the best currency bargains, the
                              fastest turnaround.*

                              In marketing, a similar acceleration is evident. "Marketers must
                              respond quickly in order to insure survival for tomorrow," declares
                              Advertising Age, reporting that "Network TV programmers ... are
                              accelerating their decisions on killing new TV series that show rating
                              weaknesses. No more waiting six or seven weeks, or a season. . . .
                              Another example: Johnson & Johnson learns that Bristol-Myers is
                              determined to undersell J&J's Tylenol.. . Does J&J adopt a wait-and-
                              see attitude? No. In an amazingly short time, it moves to cut Tylenol's
                              prices in the stores. No more weeks or months for procrastination."
                              The very prose is breathless.

                              In engineering, in manufacture, in research, in sales, in training, in
                              personnel, in every department and branch of the corporation the
                              same quickening of decision-making can be detected.

                              And once more we see a parallel process, though less advanced, in
                              the socialist industrial nations. COMF.CON. which used to revise its
                              prices every five years when it issued its five-year plan, has been
                              forced to revise its prices annually in an attempt to keep up with the
                              faster pace. Before long it will be six months, then even less.

                              The results of this generalized speedup of the corporate metabolism
                              are multiple: shorter product life-cycles, more leasing and renting,
                              more frequent buying and selline, more ephemeral consumption
                              patterns, more fads, more training time for workers (who must
                              continually adjust to new procedures), more frequent changes in]]></page><page Index="186"><![CDATA[contracts, more negotiations and legal work, more pricing changes,
                              more job turnover, more dependence on data, more ad hoc
                              organization—all of it exacerbated by inflation.

                              The result is a high-stakes, high-adrenaline business environment.
                              Under these escalating pressures it is easy to see why so many
                              businessmen, bankers, and corporate executives wonder what exactly
                              they are doing and why. Brought up with Second Wave certainties,
                              they see the world they knew tearing apart under the impact of an
                              accelerating wave of change.

                              * Nor is this function trivial. Like farmers who make more from selling
                              land than from growing food, some major corporations are making
                              more profit—or racking up greater losses—from currency and financial
                              manipulation than from actual production.

                              THE CORPORATE IDENTITY CRISIS

                              THE DE-MASSIFIED SOCIETY

                              231

                              Even more mystifying and upsetting for them is the crack-up of the
                              industrial mass society hi which they were trained to operate. Second
                              Wave managers were taught that mass production is the most
                              advanced and efficient form of production . . . that a mass market
                              wants standardized goods . . . that mass distribution is essential . . .
                              that "masses" of uniform workers are basically all alike and can be
                              motivated by uniform incentives. The effective manager learned that
                              synchronization, centralization, maximization, and concentration are
                              necessary to achieve his goals. And in a Second Wave environment
                              these assumptions are basically correct.

                              Today, as the Third Wave strikes, the corporate manager finds all his
                              old assumptions challenged. The mass society itself, for which the
                              corporation was designed, is beginning to de-massify. Not merely
                              information, production, and family life, but the marketplace and the
                              labor market as well are beginning to break into smaller, more varied
                              pieces.

                              The mass market has split into ever-multiplying, ever-changing sets of
                              mini-markets that demand a continually expanding range of options,
                              models, types, sizes, colors, and customizations. Bell Telephone,
                              which once hoped to put the same black telephone in every American
                              home—and very nearly succeeded—now manufactures some one
                              thousand combinations or permutations of telephone equipment from
                              pink, green, or white phones to phones for the blind, phones for people
                              who have lost the use of their larynx, and explosion-proof phones for
                              construction sites. Department stores, originally designed to massify
                              the market, now sprout "boutiques" under their roofs, and Phyllis
                              Sewell, a vice president of Federated Department Stores, predicts that
                              "we will be going into greater specialization . . . with more different
                              departments."

                              sions in the labor market, as reflected in the proliferation of new
                              occupations, especially in the white-collar and service fields.
                              Newspaper want ads clamor for "Vydec Secretary" or "Mini-computer
                              Programmer," while at a conference on the service professions I

                              and ombudsman.

                              As our jobs become less interchangeable, people do too. Refusing to
                              be treated as interchangeable, they arrive at the workplace with an
                              acute consciousness of their ethnic, religious, professional, sexual,
                              subcultural, and individual differences. Groups that throughout the
                              Second Wave era fought to be "integrated" or "assimilated" into mass
                              society now refuse to melt their differences. They emphasize instead
                              their unique characteristics. And Second Wave corporations, still
                              organized for operation in a mass society, are still uncertain how to
                              cope with this rising tide of diversity among their employees and
                              customers.

                              Though sharply evident in the United States, social de-mas-sification is
                              progressing rapidly elsewhere as well. In Britain, which once regarded
                              itself as highly homogeneous, ethnic minorities, from Pakistanis, West
                              Indians, Cypriots, and Ugandan Asians to Turks and Spaniards now
                              intermingle with a native population itself becoming more
                              heterogeneous. Meanwhile, a tidal influx of Japanese, American,
                              German, Dutch, Arab, and African visitors leave in their wake
                              American hamburger stands, Japanese tempura restaurants, and
                              signs in store windows that read "Se Habla Espanol."

                              Around the world, ethnic minorities reassert their identities and
                              demand long-denied rights to jobs, income, and advancement in the
                              corporation. Australian Aborigines, New Zealand Maoris, Canadian
                              Eskimos, American Blacks, Chicanos, and even Oriental minorities
                              once regarded as politically passive are on the move. From Maine to
                              the Far West, Native Americans assert "Red Power," demand the
                              restoration of tribal lands, and dicker with the OPEC countries for
                              economic and political support.

                              Even in Japan, long the most homogeneous of the nidus-trial nations,
                              the signs of de-massification are mounting. An uneducated convict

                              THE CORPORATE IDENTITY CRISIS

                              233

                              In Denmark scattered street fights break out between Danes and
                              immigrant workers and between leather-jacketed motorcyclists and
                              long-haired youth. In Belgium the Walloons, the Remish, and the
                              Bruxelloises reactivate ancient, indeed preindustrial, rivalries. In
                              Canada Quebec threatens to secede, corporations padlock their
                              headquarters in Montreal, and English-speaking executives throughout
                              the country take crash courses in French.

                              The forces that made mass society have suddenly been thrown into
                              reverse. Nationalism in the high-technology context becomes
                              regionalism instead. The pressures of the melting pot are replaced by
                              the new ethnicity. The media, instead of creating a mass culture, de-
                              massify it. In turn all these developments parallel the emerging
                              diversity of energy forms and the advance beyond mass production.

                              All these interrelated changes create a totally new framework within
                              which the production organizations of society, whether called
                              corporations or socialist enterprises, will function. Executives who
                              continue to think in terms of the mass society are shocked and
                              confused by a world they no longer recognize.

                              REDEFINING THE CORPORATION

                              What deepens the identity crisis of the corporation still further is the
                              emergence, against this already unsettling background, of a worldwide
                              movement demanding not merely modest changes hi this or that
                              corporate policy but a deep redefinition of its purposes.

                              In'the United States, writes David Ewing, an editor of the Harvard
                              Business Review, "public anger at corporations is beginning to well up
                              at a frightening rate." Ewing cites a 1977 study by a research affiliate of
                              the Harvard Business School whose findings, he says, "sent tremors
                              throughout the corporate world." The study revealed that about half of
                              all consumers polled believe they are getting worse treatment in the
                              marketplace than they were a decade earlier; three fifths say that
                              products have deteriorated; over half mistrust product guarantees.
                              Ewing quotes a worried businessman as saying, "It feels like sitting on
                              a San Andreas fault."

                              Worse yet, Ewing continues, "growing numbers of people are not
                              simply disenchanted, irritated or angry, but. . . irra-

                              ventures."

                              According to John C. Biegler, an executive of Price Water-house, one
                              of the giant blue-chip accounting firms, "public confidence in the]]></page><page Index="189"><![CDATA[American corporation is lower than at any time since the Great
                              Depression. American business and the accounting profession are
                              being called on the carpet for a kind of zero-based rejustification of just
                              about everything we do. ... Corporate performance is being measured
                              against new and unfamiliar norms."

                              Similar tendencies are visible in Scandinavia, Western Europe, and
                              even, sotto voce, in the socialist industrial nations. In Japan, as
                              Toyota's official magazine puts it, "A citizens' movement of a type
                              never before seen in Japan is gradually gathering momentum, one that
                              criticizes the way corporations disrupt everyday life."

                              Certainly corporations have come under scorching attack at other
                              times in their history. Much of today's clamor of complaint, however, is
                              crucially different and arises from the emerging values and
                              assumptions of Third Wave civilization, not the dying industrial past.

                              Throughout the Second Wave era corporations have been seen as
                              economic units, and the attacks on them have essentially focused on
                              economic issues. Critics assailed them for underpaying workers,
                              overcharging customers, forming cartels to fix prices, making shoddy
                              goods, and a thousand other economic transgressions. But no matter
                              how violent, most of these critics accepted the corporation's self-
                              definition: they shared the view of the corporation as an inherently
                              economic institution.

                              Today's corporate critics start from a totally different premise. They
                              attack the artificial divorce of economics from politics, morality, and the
                              other dimensions of life. They hold the corporation increasingly
                              responsible, not merely for its economic performance but for its side
                              effects on everything from air pollution to executive stress.
                              Corporations are thus assailed for asbestos poisoning, for using poor
                              populations as guinea pigs in drug testing, for distorting the
                              development of the non-industrial world, for racism and sexism, for
                              secrecy and deception. They are pilloried for supporting unsavory
                              regimes or political parties, from the fascist generals in Chile and the
                              racists in South Africa to the Communist party in Italy.

                              What is at issue here is not whether such charges are justi-

                              fled—all too often they are. What is far more important is I he concept
                              of the corporation they imply. For the Third Wave brings with it a rising
                              demand for a new kind of institution altogether—a corporation no
                              longer responsible simply lor making a profit or producing goods but for
                              simultaneously contributing to the solution of extremely complex
                              ecological, moral, political, racial, sexual, and social problems.

                              Instead of clinging to a sharply specialized economic function, the
                              corporation, prodded by criticism, legislation, and its own concerned
                              executives, is becoming a multipurpose institution.

                              five revolutionary changes in the actual conditions of production.
                              Changes in the physical environment, in the lineup of social forces, in
                              the role of information, in government organization, and in morality are
                              all pounding the corporation into a new, multi-faceted, multipurposeful
                              shape.

                              The first of these new pressures springs from the biosphere.

                              In the mid-1950's, when the Second Wave reached its mature stage in
                              the United States, world population stood at only 2.75 billion. Today it
                              is over 4 billion. In the mid-1950's the earth's population used a mere
                              87 quadrillion Btu of energy a year. Today we use over 260 quadrillion.
                              In the mid-50's, our consumption of a key raw material like zinc was
                              only 2.7 million metric tons a year. Today it is 5.6 million.

                              Measured any way we choose, our demands on the planet are
                              escalating wildly. As a result the biosphere is sending us alarm
                              signals—pollution, desertification, signs of toxification in the oceans,
                              subtle shifts in climate—that we ignore at the risk of catastrophe.
                              These warnings tell us we can no longer organize production as we did
                              during the Second Wave past.

                              Because the corporation is the main organizer of economic production,
                              it is also a key "producer" of environmental impacts. If we want to
                              continue our economic growth—indeed if we wish to survive—the
                              managers of tomorrow will have to assume responsibility for converting
                              the corporation's environmental impacts from negatives into positives.
                              They will assume this added responsibility voluntarily or they will be
                              compelled to do so, for the changed conditions of the biosphere make
                              it necessary. The corporation is being trans-

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              formed into an environmental, as well as an economic, institution—not
                              by do-gooders, radicals, ecologists, or government bureaucrats, but by
                              a material change in the relationship of production to the biosphere.

                              The second pressure springs from a little-noticed change in the social
                              environment in which the corporation finds itself. That environment is
                              now far more organized than before. At one time each firm operated in
                              what might be termed an un-derorganized society. Today the socio-
                              sphere, especially in the United States, has leaped to a new level of
                              organization. It is packed with a writhing, interacting mass of well-
                              organized, often well-funded, associations, agencies, trade unions, and
                              other groupings.

                              In the United States today, some 1,370,000 companies interact with
                              well over 90,000 schools and universities, 330,000 churches, and
                              hundreds of thousands of branches of 13,000 national organizations,
                              plus countless purely local environmental, social, religious, athletic,
                              political, ethnic, and civic groups, each with its own agenda and
                              priorities. It takes 144,-000 law firms to mediate all these relationships!]]></page><page Index="191"><![CDATA[In this densely crowded socio-sphere, every corporate action has
                              repercussive impacts not merely on lonely or helpless individuals but
                              on organized groups, many of them with professional staffs, a press of
                              their own, access to the political system, and resources with which to
                              hire experts, lawyers, and other assistance.

                              In this finely strung socio-sphere, corporate decisions are closely
                              scrutinized. "Social pollution" produced by the corporation in the form
                              of unemployment, community disruption, forced mobility, and the like is
                              instantly spotted, and pressures are placed on the corporation to
                              assume far greater responsibility than ever before for its social, as well
                              as economic, "products."

                              A third set of pressures reflects the changed info-sphere. Thus, the de-
                              massification of society means that far more information must be
                              exchanged between social institutions—including the corporation—to
                              maintain equilibrial relationships among them. Third Wave production
                              methods further intensify the corporation's hunger for information as
                              raw material. The firm thus sucks up data like a gigantic vacuum
                              cleaner, processes it, and disseminates it to others in increasingly
                              complex ways. As information becomes central to production, as
                              "information managers" proliferate hi industry, the corpora-

                              tion, by necessity, impacts on the informational environment exactly as
                              it impacts on the physical and social environment.

                              The new importance of information leads to conflict over the control of
                              corporate data—battles over disclosure of more information to the
                              public, demands for open accounting (of oil company production and
                              profit figures, for example), more pressures for "truth in advertising^" or
                              "truth in lending." For in the new era, "information impacts" become as
                              serious a matter as environmental and social impacts, and the
                              corporation is seen as an information producer as well as an economic
                              producer.

                              A fourth pressure on the corporation arises from politics and the
                              power-sphere. The rapid diversification of society and the acceleration
                              of change are everywhere reflected in a tremendous complexification
                              of government. The differentiation of society is mirrored in the
                              differentiation of government, and each corporation must therefore
                              interact with more and more specialized units of government. These
                              units, badly coordinated and each with its own priorities, are,
                              moreover, in a perpetual turmoil of reorganization.

                              Jayne Baker Spain, a senior vice-president of Gulf Oil, has pointed out
                              that as recently as ten or fifteen years ago, "There was no EPA. There
                              was no EEOC. There was no ER-ISSA. There was no OSHA. There
                              was no ERDA. There was no FEA." All these and many other
                              government agencies have sprouted up since then.]]></page><page Index="192"><![CDATA[Every company thus finds itself increasingly ensnarled hi politics—
                              local, regional, national, or even transnational. Conversely, every
                              important corporate decision "produces" at least indirect political
                              effects along with its other output, and is increasingly held responsible
                              for them.

                              Finally, as Second Wave civilization wanes and its value system
                              shatters, a fifth pressure arises, affecting all institutions—including the
                              corporation. This is a heightened moral pressure. Behavior once

                              scandalous. Thus the Lockheed bribes topple a government in Japan.

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              having a direct impact on the value system of the society, just as
                              significant to some as the corporation's impact on the physical
                              environment or the social system. The corporation is increasingly seen
                              as a "producer" of moral effects.

                              These five sweeping changes in both the material and non-material
                              conditions of production make untenable the Second Wave school-
                              book notion that a corporation is nothing but an economic institution.
                              Under the new conditions the corporation can no longer operate as a
                              machine for maximizing some economic function—whether production
                              or profit. The very definition of "production" is being drastically
                              expanded to include the side, as well as the central, effects, the long-
                              range as well as the immediate effects, of corporate action. Put simply,
                              every corporation has more "products" (and is now held responsible for
                              more) than Second Wave managers ever had to consider—
                              environmental, social, informational, political, and moral, not just
                              economic products.

                              The purpose of the corporation is thus changed from singular to
                              plural—not just at the level of rhetoric or public relations but at the level
                              of identity and self-definition as well.

                              In corporation after corporation we can expect to see an internal battle
                              between those who cleave to the single-purpose corporation of the
                              Second Wave past and those who are ready to cope with the Third
                              Wave conditions of production and to fight for the multipurpose
                              corporation of tomorrow.

                              insists that the corporation "is a specialized instrument designed to

                              social needs unrelated to its business operations." But while Ford and
                              other defenders of the Second Wave resist the redefinition of the

                              239

                              tion, many firms are, in fact, altering both their words and their policies.

                              Lip service and public relations rhetoric often substitute for real
                              change. Fancy promotional brochures proclaiming a new era of social
                              responsibility very often camouflage a robber-baron rapacity.
                              Nevertheless, a fundamental "paradigm shift"—a reconceptualization—
                              of the structure, goals, and responsibilities of the corporation is taking
                              place in response to new pressures brought by the Third Wave. The
                              signs of this change are numerous.

                              Amoco, a leading oil company, for example, states that "it is the policy
                              of our company, with respect to plant locations, to supplement the
                              routine economic evaluation with a detailed exploration of the social
                              consequences. . . . We look at many factors, among them the impact
                              on the physical environment, the impact on public facilities . . . and the
                              impact on local employment conditions, particularly with respect to
                              minorities." Amoco continues to weight economic considerations most
                              heavily, but it assigns importance to other factors as well. And where
                              alternative locations are simitar in economic terms but '.'different in
                              terms of the social impact," these social factors can prove decisive.

                              In the event of a merger proposal, the directors of Control Data
                              Corporation, a top U.S. computer manufacturer, explicitly take into
                              account not merely financial or economic considerations but "all
                              relevant" factors—including the social effects of the merger and its
                              impact on employees and the communities in which Control Data
                              operates. And while other companies have been racing into the
                              suburbs, Control Data has deliberately built its new plants in inner city
                              areas of Washington, St. Paul, and Minneapolis, to help provide
                              employment for minorities and to help revive urban centers. The
                              corporation states its mission as "improving the quality, equality, and
                              potential of people's lives"—equality being an unorthodox goal for a
                              corporation.

                              In the United States, the advancement of women and non-whites has
                              become a long overdue matter of national policy, and some companies
                              go so far as to reward their managers financially for meeting
                              "affirmative action" targets. At Pillsbury, a leading food, company, each
                              of its three product groups must present not only a sales plan for the
                              following year but a plan relating to the hiring, training, and promotion
                              of women and minority group members. Executive incentives are
                              linked to the attainment of these social goals. At AT&T]]></page><page Index="194"><![CDATA[240

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              all managers are evaluated annually. Fulfillment of affirmative action
                              objectives counts as part of a positive appraisal. At Chemical Bank in
                              New York, 10 to 15 percent of a branch manager's job performance
                              appraisal is based on her or his social performance—sitting on
                              community agency boards, making loans to not-for-profit organizations,
                              hiring and upgrading minorities. And at the Gannett chain of
                              newspapers, chief executive Allen Neuharth brusquely tells editors and
                              local publishers that "a major portion" of their bonuses will "be
                              determined on the basis of progress in these . . . programs."

                              Similarly, in many top corporations we see a distinct upgrading of the
                              status and influence of executives concerned with the environmental
                              consequences of corporate behavior. Some now report directly to the
                              president. Other companies have set up special committees on the
                              board of directors to define the new corporate responsibilities.

                              This social responsiveness of the corporation is not all substance.
                              Says Rosemary Bruner, director of community affairs at Hoffmann-
                              LaRoche's American subsidiary, "Some of this is pure public relations,
                              of course. Some is self-serving. But much of it actually does reflect a
                              changed perception of corporate functions." Grudgingly, therefore,
                              driven by protests, lawsuits, and fear of government action as well as
                              by more laudable motives, managers are beginning to adapt to the
                              new conditions of production and are accepting the idea that the
                              corporation has multiple purposes.

                              MANY BOTTOM LINES

                              The multipurpose corporation that is emerging demands, among other
                              things, smarter executives. It implies a management capable of
                              specifying multiple goals, weighting them, interrelating them, and
                              finding synergic policies that accomplish more than a single goal at a
                              time. It requires policies that optimize not for one, but for several
                              variables simultaneously. Nothing could be further from the single-
                              minded style of the traditional Second Wave manager.

                              Moreover, once the need for multiple goals is accepted we are
                              compelled to invent new measures of performance. Instead of the
                              single "bottom line" on which most executives have been taught to
                              fixate, the Third Wave corporation requires attention to multiple bottom
                              lines—social, environmen-

                              Faced with this new complexity, many of today's managers are taken
                              aback. They lack the intellectual tools necessary for Third Wave
                              management. We know how to measure the profitability of a]]></page><page Index="195"><![CDATA[corporation, but how do we measure or evaluate the achievement of
                              non-economic goals? Price Waterhouse's John C. Biegler says,
                              managers "are being asked to account for corporate behavior in areas
                              where no real standards of accountability have been established—
                              where even the language of accountability has yet to be developed."

                              This explains today's efforts to develop a new language of
                              accountability. Indeed, accounting itself is on the edge of revolution
                              and is about to explode out of Its narrowly economic terms of
                              reference.

                              The American Accounting Association, for example, has issued reports
                              of a "Committee on Non-Financial Measures of Effectiveness" and of a
                              "Committee on Measures of Effectiveness for Social Programs." So
                              much work is being done along these lines that each of these reports
                              lists nearly 250 papers, monographs, and documents in its
                              bibliography.

                              In Philadelphia, a consulting firm called the Human Resources Network
                              is working with twelve major U.S. corporations to develop cross-
                              industry methods for specifying what might be called the "trans-
                              economic" goals of the corporation. It is trying to integrate these goals
                              into corporate planning and to find ways of measuring the company's
                              trans-economic performance. In Washington, meanwhile, the
                              Secretary of Commerce, Juanita Kreps, raised a storm of controversy
                              by suggesting that the government itself should prepare a "Social
                              Performance Index," which she described as a "mechanism companies
                              could use to assess their performance and its social consequences."

                              Parallel work is under way in Europe. According to Meinolf Dierkes and
                              Rob Coppock of the Berlin-based International Institute for
                              Environment and Society, "Many large and medium-sized companies
                              in Europe have been experimenting with [the social report] concept. ...
                              In the Federal Republic of Germany, for example, about 20 of the
                              largest firms now publish social reports regularly. In addition, more
                              than a hundred others draw up social reports for internal management
                              purposes."

                              Some of these reports are no more than puff—accounts of the
                              corporation's "good works," carefully overlooking contro-

                              versial problems like pollution. But others are remarkably open,
                              objective, and tough. Thus a social report issued by the giant Swiss
                              food firm, Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund self-criti-cally confesses that
                              it pays women less than men, that many of its jobs are "extremely
                              boring," and that its nitrous dioxide emissions have risen over a four-
                              year period. Says the company's managing director, Pierre Arnold, "It
                              takes courage for an enterprise to point out the differences between its
                              goals and its actual results."

                              Companies like STEAG and the Saarbergwerke AG have pioneered
                              the effort to relate company expenditures to specific social benefits.]]></page><page Index="196"><![CDATA[Less formally, companies like Bertelsmann AG, the publisher; Rank
                              Xerox GmbH, the copier firm; and Hoechst AG, the chemical
                              manufacturer, have radically broadened the kind of social data they
                              make available to the public.

                              A much more advanced system is employed by companies in Sweden
                              and Switzerland and by Deutsche Shell AG in Germany. The latter,
                              instead of publishing an annual report, now issues what it calls an
                              Annual and Social Report in which both economic and trans-economic
                              data are interrelated. The method used by Shell, termed "goal
                              accounting and reporting" by Dierkes and Coppock, stipulates concrete
                              economic, environmental, and social goals for the corporation, spells
                              out the actions taken to achieve them, and reports the expenditures
                              allocated to them.

                              Shell also lists five overall corporate goals—only one of which is to

                              that each of the five goals, economic and non-economic, must "carry
                              the same weight" in corporate decision-making. The goal accounting
                              method forces companies to make their trans-economic objectives,
                              explicit, to specify time periods for their attainment, and to open this up
                              to public review.

                              On a broader theoretical level, Trevor Gambling, professor of
                              accounting at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, in a
                              book called Societal Accounting has called for a radical reformulation
                              of accounting that begins to integrate the work of economists and
                              accountants with that of the social scientists who have developed
                              social indicators and methods of social accounting.

                              In Holland the Dean of the Graduate School of Management in Delft,
                              Cornelius Brevoord, has designed a set of multidimensional criteria for
                              monitoring corporate behavior. This

                              THE CORPORATE IDENTITY CRISIS

                              is made necessary, he suggests, by deep value changes in the
                              society, among them the change from "an economic production
                              orientation" in society to "a total well-being orientation." Similarly, he
                              notes a shift from "functional specialization to an interdisciplinary
                              approach." Both these changes strengthen the need for a more
                              rounded concept of the corporation.

                              Brevoord lists 32 different criteria by which a corporation must
                              measure its effectiveness. These range over its relationships with
                              consumers, shareholders, and unions to those with ecology
                              organizations and its own management. But, he points out, even these
                              32 are only "a few" of the parameters along which the emerging
                              corporation of the future will test itself.

                              With the Second Wave economic infrastructure in a shambles, with
                              change accelerating as de-massification spreads, with the biosphere
                              sending danger signals, with the level of organization in society rising,]]></page><page Index="197"><![CDATA[and the informational, political, and ethical conditions of production
                              changing, the Second Wave corporation is obsolete.

                              What is happening, therefore, is a thoroughgoing reconcep-tualization
                              of the meaning of production and of the institution that, until now, has
                              been charged with organizing it. The result is a complex shift to a new-
                              style corporation of tomorrow. In the words of William Halal, professor
                              of management at American University, "Just as the feudal manor was
                              replaced by the business corporation when agrarian societies were
                              transformed into industrial societies, so too should the older model of
                              the firm be replaced by a new form of economic institution. . . ." This
                              new institution will combine economic and trans-economic objectives.
                              It will have multiple bottom lines.

                              The transformation of the corporation is part of the larger
                              transformation of the socio-sphere as a whole, and this in turn parallels
                              the dramatic changes in the techno-sphere and info-sphere. Taken
                              together, they add up to a massive historical shift. But we are not
                              merely altering these giant structures. We are also changing the way
                              ordinary people, in their daily lives, behave. For when we change the
                              deep structure of civilization, we simultaneously rewrite all the codes
                              by which we live.

                              DECODING THE NEW RULES

                              In millions of middle-class homes a ritual drama is enacted: the
                              recently graduated son or daughter arrives late for dinner, snarls, flings
                              down the want ads, and proclaims the nine-to-five job a degrading
                              sham and a shuck. No human being with even a shredlet of self-
                              respect would submit to the nine-to-five regimen.

                              Enter parents:

                              The father, just returned from his own nine-to-five job, and the mother,
                              exhausted and depressed from paying the latest batch of bills, are
                              outraged. They have been through this before. Having seen good
                              times and bad, they suggest a secure job with a big corporation. The
                              young person sneers. Small companies are better. No company is best
                              of all. An advanced degree? What for? It's all a terrible waste!

                              Aghast, the parents see their suggestions dismissed one after another.
                              Their frustration mounts until, at last, they utter the ultimate parental
                              cry: "When are you going to face the real world?"

                              Such scenes are not limited to affluent homes in the United States or
                              even Europe. Japanese corporate moguls mutter in their sake" about
                              the swift decline of the work ethic and corporate loyalty, of industrial
                              punctuality and discipline among the young. Even in the Soviet Union
                              middle-class parents face similar challenges from the youth.

                              Is this just another case of epater les parents—the traditional
                              generational conflict? Or is there something new here? Can it be that
                              young people and their parents are simply not talking about the same
                              "real world"? 244

                              The fact is that what we are seeing is not merely the classical
                              confrontation of romantic youth and realistic elders. Indeed, what was
                              once realistic may no longer be. For the basic code of behavior,
                              containing the ground rules of social life, is changing rapidly as the
                              onrashing Third Wave arrives.

                              We saw earlier how the Second Wave brought with it a "code book" of
                              principles or rules that governed everyday behavior. Such principles as
                              synchronization, standardization, or maximization were applied hi
                              business, in government, and in a daily life obsessed with punctuality
                              and schedules.

                              Today a countercode book is emerging—new ground rules for the new
                              life we are building on a de-massified economy, on de-massified
                              media, on new family and corporate structures. Many of the seemingly
                              senseless battles between young and old, as well as other conflicts in
                              our classrooms, boardrooms, and political backrooms are, in fact,
                              nothing more than clashes over which code book to apply.

                              The new code book directly attacks much of what the Second Wave
                              person has been taught to believe in—from the importance of
                              punctuality and synchronization to the need for conformity and
                              standardization. It challenges the presumed efficiency of centralization
                              and professionalization. It compels us to reconsider our conviction that
                              bigger is better and our notions of "concentration." To understand this
                              new code, and how it contrasts with the old one, is to understand
                              instantly many of the otherwise confusing conflicts that swirl around us,
                              exhausting our energies and threatening our personal power, prestige,
                              or paycheck.

                              THE END OF NINE-TO-FIVE

                              Take the case of the frustrated parents. Second Wave civilization, as
                              we saw, synchronized daily life, tying the rhythms of sleep and
                              wakefulness, of work and play, to the underlying throb of machines.
                              Raised in this civilization, the parents take for granted that work must
                              be synchronized, that everyone must arrive and work at the same tune,
                              that rush-hour traffic is'unavoidable, that meal times must be fixed, and
                              that children must, at an early age, be indoctrinated with time-
                              consciousness and punctuality. They cannot understand why their
                              offspring seem so annoyingly casual about keeping appointments and
                              why, if the nine-to-five job (or other fixed-

                              regarded as intolerable by their children.

                              The reason is that the Third Wave, as it sweeps in, carries with it a
                              completely different sense of tune. If the Second Wave tied life to the
                              tempo of the machine, the Third Wave challenges this mechanical]]></page><page Index="199"><![CDATA[synchronization, alters our most basic social rhythms, and in so doing
                              frees us from the machine.

                              Once we understand this, it comes as no surprise that one of the
                              fastest-spreading innovations in industry during the 1970's was
                              "fiextime"—an arrangement that permits workers, within predetermined
                              limits, to choose their own working hours. Instead of requiring
                              everyone to arrive at the factory gate or the office at the same time, or
                              even at pre-fixed staggered times, the company operating on fiextime
                              typically sets certain core hours when everyone is expected to show
                              up, and specifies other hours as flexible. Each employee may choose
                              which of the flexible hours he or she wishes to spend working.

                              This means that a "day person"—a person whose biological rhythms
                              routinely awaken him or her early in the morning—can choose to arrive
                              at work at, say, 8:00 A.M., while a "night person," whose metabolism is
                              different, can choose to start working at 10:00 or 10:30 A.M. It means
                              that an employee can take tune off for household chores, or to shop, or
                              to take a child to the doctor. Groups of workers who wish to go bowling
                              together early in the morning or late in the afternoon can jointly set
                              then* schedules to make it possible. In short, time itself is being de-
                              massified.

                              The flextime movement began in 1965 when a woman economist in
                              Germany, Christel Kammerer, recommended it as a way to bring more
                              mothers into the job market. In 1967 Masserschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm, the
                              "Deutsche Boeing," discovered that many of its workers were arriving
                              at work worn out from fighting rush-hour traffic. Management gingerly
                              experimented by allowing 2,000 workers to go off the rigid eight-to-five
                              schedule and to choose their own hours. Within two years all 12,000 of
                              its employees were on flextime and some departments had even given
                              up the requirements for everyone to be there during core time.

                              In 1972 Europa magazine reported that ". . . in some 2,-000 West
                              German firms, the national concept of rigid punctuality has vanished

                              "sliding" or "flexible" hours. By 1977 fully a fourth of the West German

                              than 5,000,000 employees in all, were on one or another form of
                              flextime, and the system was being used by 22,000 companies with an
                              estimated 4,000,000 workers in France, Finland, Denmark, Sweden,
                              Italy, and Great Britain. In Switzerland, 15 to 20 percent of all industrial
                              firms had switched to the new system for all or part of their work force.

                              Multinational firms (a major force for cultural diffusion in today's world)
                              soon began exporting the system from Europe. Nestle and Lufthansa,
                              for example, introduced it to their operations in the United States. By
                              1977, according to a report prepared for the American Management
                              Association by Professor Stanley Nollen and consultant Virginia Martin,
                              13 percent of all U.S. companies were using flexible hours. Within a

                              trying out flextime systems are such giants as Scott Paper, Bank of
                              California, General Motors, Bristol-Myers, and Equitable Life.

                              Some of the more moss-backed trade unions—preservers of the
                              Second Wave status quo—have hesitated. But individual workers, by
                              and large, see flextime as a liberating influence. Says the manager of
                              one London-based insurance firm: "The young married women were
                              absolutely rapturous about the change-over." A Swiss survey found
                              that fully 95 percent of affected workers approve. Thirty-five percent—
                              men more than women—say they now spend more time with the
                              family.

                              One Black mother working for a Boston bank was on the verge of
                              being fired because—although a good worker in other respects—she
                              was continually turning up late. Her poor attendance record reinforced
                              racist stereotypes about the "unreliability" and "laziness" of Black
                              workers. But when her office went on flextime she was no longer
                              considered late. It turned out, reported sociologist Allen R. Cohen, "that
                              she'd been late because she had to drop her son in a day-care center
                              and could just never get to the office by starting time."

                              Employers, for their part, report higher productivity, reduced
                              absenteeism, and other benefits. There are, of course, problems, as
                              with any innovation, but according to the AMA survey only 2 percent of
                              the companies trying it have gone back to the old rigid time structure.
                              One Lufthansa manager summed it up succinctly: "There's no such
                              thing now as a punctuality problem."

                              248 THE: THIRD WAVE

                              THE SLEEPLESS GORGON

                              But flextime, while widely publicized, is only a small part of the general
                              restructuring of time that the Third Wave carries with it. We are also
                              seeing a powerful shift toward increased night work. This is occurring
                              not so much in the traditional manufacturing centers like Akron or
                              Baltimore, which have always had a lot of workers on night shifts, but
                              in the rapidly expanding services and in the advanced, computer-
                              based industries.

                              "The modern city," declares the French newspaper Le Monde, "is a
                              Gorgon that never sleeps and in which ... a growing proportion of the
                              citizens work outside the [normal] diurnal rhythms." Across the board in
                              the technological nations the number of night workers now runs
                              between 15 and -25 percent of all employees. In France, for example,
                              the percentage has soared from only 12 in 1957 to 21 by 1974. In the
                              United States the number of full-time night workers jumped 13 percent
                              between 1974 and 1977; the total, including part-timers, reached 13.5
                              million.

                              Even more dramatic has been the spread of part-time work—and the
                              active preference for it expressed by large numbers of people. In the
                              Detroit area an estimated 65 percent of the total work force at the J. L.
                              Hudson department stores consists of part-timers. Prudential
                              Insurance employs some 1,600 part-timers in its U.S. and Canadian]]></page><page Index="201"><![CDATA[offices. In all, there is now one voluntary part-time worker for every five
                              full-timers in the United States, and the part-time work force has been
                              growing twice as fast as the full-time force since 1954.

                              So far has this process advanced that a 1977 study by researchers at
                              Georgetown University suggested that in the future almost all jobs
                              could be part-time. Entitled Permanent Part-Time Employment: The
                              Manager's Perspective, the study covered 68 corporations, more than
                              half of which already used part-timers. Even more noteworthy is the
                              fact that the percentage of unemployed workers who want only part-
                              time work has doubled in the past twenty years.

                              The opening up of part-time jobs is particularly welcomed by women,
                              by the elderly and semi-retired, and by many young people who are
                              willing to settle for a smaller paycheck in return for time to pursue their
                              own hobbies, sports, or religious, artistic, or political interests.

                              What we see, therefore, is a fundamental break with Sec-

                              ond Wave synchronization. The combination of flextime, part-time, and
                              night work means that more and more people are working outside the
                              nine-to-five (or any fixed schedule) system, and that the entire society
                              is shifting to round-the-clock operations.

                              New consumer patterns, meanwhile, directly parallel changes in the
                              time structure of production. Note, for instance, the proliferation of all-
                              night supermarkets. "Will the 4 A.M. shopper, long considered a
                              hallmark of California kook-iness, become a regular feature of life in
                              the less flamboyant East?" asks The New York Times. The answer is a
                              resounding "Yes!"

                              A spokesman for a supermarket chain in the eastern United States
                              says his company will keep its stores open all night because **people
                              are staying up later than they used to." The Times feature writer
                              spends a night at a typical store and reports on the varied customers
                              who take advantage of the late hours: a truck driver whose wife is ill
                              shops for his family of six, a young woman on her way to a
                              postmidnight date pops by to purchase a greeting card, a man up late
                              with a sick daughter rushes in to buy her a toy banjo and stops to pick
                              up a hibachi as well, a woman drops by after her ceramics class to do
                              the week's shopping, a motorcyclist roars up at 3:00 A.M. to buy a
                              deck of cards, two men straggle in at dawn on their way to go fishing....

                              Mealtimes are also affected by these changes and are similarly
                              desynchronized. People do not all eat at the same time, as most of
                              them once did. The rigid three-meal-a-day pattern is broken as more
                              and more fast-food shops spring up, serving billions of meals at all
                              hours. Television watching changes, too, as programmers devise
                              shows specifically aimed at "urban adults, night workers, and just plain
                              insomniacs." Banks, meanwhile, give up their celebrated "bankers'
                              hours."]]></page><page Index="202"><![CDATA[Manhattan's giant Citibank runs television commercials for its new

                              ety now treats time, we find a subtle but powerful shift away from the
                              rhythms of the Second Wave and toward a new temporal structure in
                              our lives. In fact, what is happening is a de-massification of time that
                              precisely parallels the de-massifi-cation of other features of social life
                              as the Third Wave sweeps in.

                              SCHEDULE-A-FRIEND

                              We are only just beginning to feel the social consequences of this
                              restructuring of time. For example, while the increasing
                              individualization of time patterns certainly makes work less onerous, it
                              also can intensify loneliness and social isolation. If friends, lovers, and
                              family all work at different hours, and new services are not laid in place
                              to help them coordinate their personal schedules, it becomes
                              increasingly difficult for them to arrange face-to-face social contact.
                              The old social centers—the neighborhood pub, the church clambake,
                              the school prom—are losing their traditional significance. In their place,
                              new Third Wave institutions must be invented to facilitate social life.

                              One can, for example, easily imagine a new computerized service—
                              call it "Pers-Sched" or "Friend-Sched"—that not only reminds you of
                              your own appointments but stores the schedules of various friends and
                              family members so that each person in the social network can, by
                              pushing a button, find out where and when his or her friends and
                              acquaintances will be, and can make arrangements accordingly. But
                              far more significant social facilitators will be needed.

                              The de-massification of time has other consequences, too. Thus we
                              can already begin to see its effects in transportation. The Second
                              Wave insistence on rigid, mass work schedules brought with it the
                              characteristic rush-hour crush. The de-massification of time
                              redistributes traffic flows in both space and time.

                              In fact, one crude way to judge just how far the Third Wave has
                              advanced in any community is to look at the traffic flows. If the peak
                              hours are still heavily accented, and if all the traffic moves one way in
                              the morning and reverses itself in the evening, Second Wave
                              synchronization still prevails. If traffic flows all day long, as it does in an
                              increasing number of cities, and moves in all directions, rather than
                              merely back and forth, it is safe to assume that Third Wave industries

                              workers, that flextime has begun to spread, that part-time and night
                              work are prevalent, and that all-night services—superettes, banks, gas
                              stations, and restaurants— will not be far behind.

                              The shift toward more flexible and personalized schedules also
                              reduces energy costs and pollution by leveling out peak loads. Electric
                              utilities in a dozen states are now using "time-of-day" pricing for
                              industrial and residential customers to discourage energy use during
                              traditional peak hours, while Connecticut's Department of
                              Environmental Protection has urged companies to institute flextime as
                              a means of complying with federal environmental requirements.

                              These are among the most obvious implications of the time shift As the
                              process continues to unfold in the years and decades ahead, we will
                              see far more powerful and as yet unimag-ined consequences. The new
                              time patterns will affect our daily rhythms in the home. They will affect
                              our art. They will affect our biology. For when we touch on time we
                              touch on all of human experience.

                              COMPUTERS AND MARIJUANA

                              These Third Wave rhythms spring from deep psychological, economic,
                              and technological forces. At one level they arise from the changed
                              nature of the population. People today—more affluent and educated
                              than their parents and faced with more life choices—simply refuse to
                              be massified. The more people differ in terms of the work they do or
                              the products "they consume, the more they demand to be treated as
                              individuals—and the more they resist socially imposed schedules.

                              But at another level the new, more personalized Third Wave rhythms
                              can be traced to a wide range of new technologies moving into our
                              lives. Video cassettes and home video recording, for example, make it
                              possible for televiewers to tape programs off the air and view them at
                              times of their own choosing. Writes columnist Steven Brill, "Within the
                              next two or three years television will probably stop dictating the
                              schedules of even the worst tube addicts." The power of the great
                              networks—the NBCs, the BBCs or NHKs—to synchronize viewing is
                              coming to an end.

                              The computer, too, is beginning to recast our schedules

                              and even our conceptions of time. Indeed it is the computer which has
                              made flextime possible in large organizations. At its simplest it
                              facilitates the complex interweaving of thousands of personalized,
                              flexible schedules. But it also alters our communications patterns in
                              time, permitting us to access data and exchange it both
                              "synchronously" (i.e., simultaneously) and "asynchronously."

                              What that means is illustrated by the growing number of computer
                              users who are today engaged in "computer conferencing." This permits

                              educators today in several countries conduct lengthy discussions of
                              energy, economics, decentralization, or space satellites with one
                              another through what is known as the Electronic Information Exchange
                              System. Teleprinters and video screens in their homes and offices
                              provide a choice of either instant or delayed communication. Many
                              time zones apart, each user can choose to send or retrieve data
                              whenever it is most convenient. A person, can work at 3:00 A.M. if he
                              or she feels like it. Alternatively, several can go on line at the same
                              time if they so choose.

                              But the computer's effect on time goes much deeper, influencing even
                              the way we think about it. The computer introduces a new vocabulary
                              (with terms like "real-time," for example) that clarifies, labels, and
                              reconceptualizes temporal phenomena. It begins to replace the clock
                              as the most important timekeeping or pace-setting device in society.

                              Computer operations take place so rapidly that we routinely process
                              data in what might be termed "subliminal time"—intervals far too short
                              for the human senses to detect or for human neural response times to
                              match. We now have computer-operated microprinters capable of
                              turning out 10-000 to 20,000 lines per minute—more than 200 times
                              faster than anyone can read them, and this is still the slowest part of
                              computer systems. In twenty years computer scientists have gone from
                              speaking in terms of milliseconds (thousandths of a second) to
                              nanoseconds (billionths of a second) —a compression of tune almost
                              beyond our powers to imagine. It is as though a person's entire
                              working life of, say 80,000 paid hours—2,000 hours per year for forty
                              years—could be crunched into a mere 4.8 minutes.

                              Beyond the computer we find other technologies or products that also
                              move in the direction of de-massifying time. Mood-influencing drugs

                              perception of time within us. As far more sophisticated mood drugs
                              appear it is likely that, for good or for ill, even our interior sense of time,
                              our experience of duration, will become further individualized and less
                              universally shared.

                              During Second Wave civilization machines were clumsily synchronized
                              to one another, and people on the assembly line were then
                              synchronized to the machines, with all the many social consequences
                              that flowed from this fact. Today, machine synchronization has
                              reached such exquisitely, high levels, and the pace of even the fastest
                              human workers is so ridiculously slow by comparison, that full
                              advantage of the technology can be derived not by coupling workers to
                              the machine but only by decoupling them from it.

                              Put differently, during Second Wave civilization, machine
                              synchronization shackled the human to the machine's capabilities and
                              imprisoned all of social life in a common frame. It did so in capitalist
                              and socialist societies alike. Now, as machine synchronization grows]]></page><page Index="205"><![CDATA[more precise, humans, instead of being imprisoned, are progressively
                              freed.

                              One of the psychological consequences of this is a change in the very
                              meaning of punctuality in our lives. We are moving now from an
                              across-the-board punctuality to selective or situational punctuality.
                              Being on time—as our children perhaps dimly sense—no longer
                              means what it used to mean.

                              Punctuality, as we saw earlier, was not terribly important during First
                              Wave civilization—basically because agricultural work was not highly
                              interdependent. With the coming of the Second Wave one worker's
                              lateness could immediately and dramatically disrupt the work of many
                              others in factory or office. Hence the enormous cultural pressure to
                              assure punctuality. -

                              Today, because the Third Wave brings with it personalized instead of
                              universal or massified schedules, the consequences of being late are
                              less clear. To be late may inconvenience a friend or co-worker, but its
                              disruptive effects on production, while still potentially severe in certain
                              jobs, are less and less obvious. It is harder—especially for young
                              people—to tell when punctuality is really important and when it is
                              demanded out of mere force of habit, courtesy, or ritual. Punctuality
                              remains vital in some situations but, as the computer spreads and
                              people are permitted to plug into and out of round-the-clock cycles at
                              will, the number of workers whose effectiveness depends on it
                              decreases.

                              The result is less pressure to be "on time" and the spread

                              of more casual attitudes toward time among the young. Punctuality,
                              like morality, becomes situational.

                              In short, as the Third Wave moves in, challenging the old industrial
                              way of doing things, it changes the relationship of the entire civilization
                              to time. The old mechanical synchronization that destroyed so much of
                              the spontaneity and joy of life and virtually symbolized the Second
                              Wave is on its way out. The young people who reject the nine-to-five
                              regime, who are indifferent to classical punctuality, may not understand
                              why they behave as they do. But time itself has changed in the "real
                              world," and along with it we have changed the ground rules that once
                              governed us.

                              The Third Wave does more than alter Second Wave patterns of
                              synchronization. It attacks another basic feature of industrial life:
                              standardization.

                              The hidden code of Second Wave society encouraged a steamroller

                              customize (as opposed to standardize) at lowest cost, and find
                              ingenious ways of applying the latest technology to the
                              individualization of products and services. In employment the numbers
                              of workers doing identical work grows smaller and smaller as the
                              variety of occupations increases. Wages and fringe benefits begin to
                              vary more from worker to worker. Workers themselves become more
                              different from one another, and since they (and we) are also
                              consumers, the differences immediately translate into the marketplace.

                              The shift away from traditional mass production thus is accompanied
                              by a parallel de-massification of marketing, merchandising, and of
                              consumption. Consumers begin to make their choices not only
                              because a product fulfills a specific material or psychological function
                              but also because of the way it fits into the larger configuration of
                              products and services they require. These highly individualized
                              configurations are transient, as are the life-styles they help to define.

                              standardized production brings with it post-standardized consumption.

                              Even prices, standardized during the Second Wave period, begin to be
                              less standard now, since custom products require custom pricing. The
                              price tag for an automobile depends on the particular package of
                              options selected; the price of a hi-fi set similarly depends on the units
                              that are plugged together and on how much work the buyer wishes to
                              do; the prices of aircraft, offshore oil rigs, ships, computers, and other
                              high-technology items vary from one unit to the next.

                              In politics we see similar trends. Our views are increasingly non-
                              standard as consensus breaks down in nation after nation and
                              thousands of "issue groups" spring up, each fighting for its own narrow,
                              often temporary, set of goals. In turn, the culture itself is increasingly
                              de-standardized.

                              Thus we see the breakup of the mass mind as the new
                              communications media described in Chapter Thirteen come into play.
                              The de-massification of the mass media—the rise of mini-magazines,
                              newsletters, and small scale, often Xeroxed, communications along
                              with the coming of cable, cassette, and computer—shatters the
                              standardized image of the world propagated by Second Wave
                              communications technologies, and pumps a diversity of images, ideas,
                              symbols, and values into society. Not only are we using customized
                              products, we are using diverse symbols to customize our view of the
                              world.

                              Nothing underlines this process of cultural de-standardization more
                              crisply than a recent article in Christianity Today, a leading voice of
                              conservative Protestantism in America. The editor writes, "Many
                              Christians seem confused by the availability of so many different
                              translations of the Bible. Older Christians did not face so many
                              choices." Then conies the punch line. "Christianity Today recommends
                              that no version should be the 'standard.'" Even within the narrow
                              bounds of Biblical translation, as in religion generally, the notion of a
                              single standard is passing. Our religious views, like our tastes, are
                              becoming less uniform and standardized.

                              The net effect is to carry us away from the Huxleyan or Orwellian
                              society of faceless, de-individualized humanoids

                              and, instead, toward a profusion of life-styles and more highly
                              individualized personalities. We are watching the rise of a "post-
                              standardized mind" and a "post-standardized public."

                              This will bring its own social, psychological, and philosophical
                              problems, some of which we are already feeling in the loneliness and
                              social isolation around us, but these are dramatically different from the
                              problems of mass conformity that exercised us during the industrial
                              age.

                              Because the Third Wave is not yet dominant even in the most
                              technically advanced nations, we continue to feel the tug of powerful
                              Second Wave currents. We are still completing some of the unfinished
                              business of the Second Wave. For example, hard-cover book
                              publishing in the United States, long a backward industry, is only now
                              reaching the stage of mass-merchandising that paperback publishing
                              and most other consumer industries attained more than a generation
                              ago. Other Second Wave movements seem almost quixotic, like the
                              one that urges us at this late stage to adopt the metric system in the
                              United States to bring American measurements into conformity with
                              those used in Europe. Still others derive from bureaucratic empire
                              building, like the effort of Common Market technocrats in Brussels to
                              "harmonise" everything from auto mirrors to college diplomas—
                              "harmonisa-tion" being the current gobbledygook for industrial-style
                              standardization.

                              Finally, there are movements aimed at literally turning back the clock—
                              like the back-to-basics movement in United States schools.
                              Legitimately outraged by the disaster in mass education, it does not
                              recognize that a de-massified society calls for new educational
                              strategies, but seeks instead to restore and enforce Second Wave
                              uniformity in the schools.

                              Nevertheless, all these attempts to achieve uniformity are essentially
                              the rearguard actions of a spent civilization. The thrust of Third Wave

                              Having seen how swiftly we are moving away from industrial-style

                              are also rewriting other sections of the social code.

                              We saw earlier that, while all societies need some measure of both
                              centralization and decentralization, Second Wave civilization was
                              heavily biased toward the former and against the latter. The Great
                              Standardizes who helped build industrialism marched hand in hand
                              with the Great Centralizers, from Hamilton and Lenin down to

                              parties, new management techniques, and new philosophies are
                              springing up that explicitly attack the centralist premises of the Second
                              Wave. Decentralization has become a hot political issue from
                              California to Kiev.

                              In Sweden a coalition of largely decentralist small parties drove the
                              centralist Social Democrats from power after 44 years in office.
                              Struggles over decentralization and regionalism have shaken France in
                              recent years, while across the Channel and to the north the Scottish
                              Nationalists now include a wing committed to "radical economic
                              decentralization." Similar political movements can be identified
                              elsewhere in Western Europe, while in New Zealand a still-small
                              Values Party has sprouted, demanding "an expansion of the functions
                              and autonomy of local and regional government . . . with a consequent
                              reduction in the functions and size of central government."

                              In the United States, too, decentralism has picked up support, and
                              supplies at least some of the fuel for the tax revolt that is, for good or
                              for ill, surging across the country. On the municipal level, too,
                              decentralism gains force, with local politicos demanding "neighborhood
                              power." Activist, neighborhood-based groups are proliferating, from
                              ROBBED (Residents Organized for Better and Beautiful Environmental
                              Development) in San Antonio, to CBBB (Citizens to Bring Broadway
                              Back) in Cleveland and the People's Firehouse in Brooklyn. Many see
                              the central government in Washington as the source of local ills rather
                              than the potential cure.

                              and civil rights activist and now the Assistant Secretary for
                              Neighborhoods in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
                              Development, such small, decentralized groups reflect the breakdown
                              of machine politics and the inability of big government to cope with the
                              wide diversity of local conditions and people. Says The New York
                              Times, neighborhood activists are winning "victories in Washington and
                              across the country."

                              The decentralist philosophy is being spread, moreover, in schools of
                              architecture and planning, from Berkeley to Yale in the United States to
                              the Architectural Association in London, where students are, among
                              other things, exploring new technologies for environmental control,
                              solar heating, or urban agriculture with the aim of making communities
                              partially self-sufficient in the future. The impact of these young
                              planners and architects will be increasingly felt in the years to come as
                              they move into responsible positions.

                              More important, however, the term "decentralization" has also become
                              a buzzword in management, and large companies are racing to break
                              their departments down into smaller, more autonomous "profit
                              centers." A typical case was the reorganization of Esmark, Inc., a huge
                              company with operations in the food, chemical, oil, and insurance
                              industries.

                              "In the past," declared Esmark's chairman, Robert Reneker, "we had
                              an unwieldly business. . . . The only way we could develop coordinated
                              effort was to divide it into bite-size bits." The result: an Esmark cut into
                              1,000 different "profit centers," each one largely responsible for its own
                              operations.

                              "The net effect," said Business Week, "is to lift the routine decision-
                              making from Reneker's shoulders. Decentralization is evident
                              everywhere but in Esmark's financial controls."

                              What is important is not Esmark—which has probably reorganized
                              itself more than once since—but the general tendency it illustrates.
                              Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of companies are also in the process of
                              continual reorganization, decentralizing, sometimes overshooting and
                              swinging back, but gradually, over time, reducing centralized control
                              over their day-to-day operations.

                              At an even deeper level, large organizations are changing the authority
                              patterns that underpinned centralism. The typical Second Wave firm or
                              government agency was organized around the principle of "one man,
                              one boss." While an em-

                              ployee or an executive might have many subordinates, he or she
                              would never report to more than a single superior. This principle meant
                              that the channels of command all went to the center.]]></page><page Index="210"><![CDATA[Today it is fascinating to watch that system crack under its own weight
                              in the advanced industries, in the services, the professions, and many
                              government agencies. The fact is, growing multitudes of us today have
                              more than a single boss.

                              In Future Shock I pointed out that big organizations were increasingly
                              honeycombed by temporary units like task forces, interdepartmental
                              committees, and project teams. I termed this phenomenon "ad-
                              hocracy." Since then, many large companies have moved to
                              incorporate these transient units into a radically new formal structure
                              called "matrix organization." Instead of centralized control, matrix
                              organization employs what is known as a "multiple command system."

                              Under this arrangement, each employee is attached to a department
                              and reports to a superior in customary fashion. But he or she is also
                              assigned to one or more teams for jobs that can't be done by a single
                              department. Thus a typical project team may have people from
                              manufacturing, from research, sales, engineering, finance, and from
                              other departments as well. The members of this team all report to the
                              project leader as well as to a "regular" boss.

                              The result is that vast numbers of people today report to one boss for
                              purely administrative purposes and another (or a succession of others)
                              for practical get-the-work-done purposes. This system lets employees
                              give attention to more than one task at a time. It speeds up the flow of
                              information and avoids their looking at problems through the narrow slit
                              of a single department. It helps the organization respond to different,
                              quickly changing circumstances. But it also actively subverts
                              centralized control.

                              Spreading from such early users as General Electric in the United
                              States and Skandia Insurance in Sweden, the matrix-style organization
                              is now found in everything from hospitals and accounting firms to the
                              U.S. Congress (where all sorts of new, semiformal "clearinghouses"
                              and "caucuses" are springing up across committee lines). Matrix, in the
                              words of Professors S. M. Davis of Boston University and P. R.
                              Lawrence of Harvard, "is not just another minor management
                              technique or a passing fad ... it represents a sharp break ... matrix
                              represents a new species of business organization."

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              And this new species is inherently less centralized than the old one-
                              boss system that characterized the Second Wave era.

                              Most important, we are also radically decentralizing the economy as a
                              whole. Witness the rising power of small regional banks in the United
                              States as against that of the handful of traditional "money market"
                              giants. (As industry becomes more geographically dispersed, firms that
                              previously had to rely on "money center" banks have increasingly
                              turned to the regionals. Says Kenneth L. Roberts, president of First
                              American, a Nashville bank, "The future of U.S. banking no longer lies
                              with the money market banks.") And as with the banking system, so
                              too with the economy itself.]]></page><page Index="211"><![CDATA[The Second Wave gave rise to the first truly national markets and the
                              very concept of a national economy. Along with these came the
                              development of national tools for economic management—central
                              planning in the socialist nations, central banks and national monetary
                              and fiscal policies in the capitalist sector. Today 'both these sets of
                              tools are failing—to the mystification of the Second Wave economists
                              and politicians who try to manage the system.

                              Although the fact is only dimly appreciated as yet, national economies
                              are swiftly breaking down into regional and sectoral parts—subnational
                              economies with distinctive and differing problems of their own.
                              Regions, whether the Sun Belt in the United States, the Mezzogiorno
                              in Italy, or Kansai in Japan, instead of growing more alike as they did
                              during the industrial era, are beginning to diverge from one another in
                              terms of energy requirements, resources, occupational mix,
                              educational levels, culture, and other key factors. Moreover, many of
                              these subnational economies have now reached the scale of national
                              economies only a generation ago.

                              Failure to recognize this accounts in good measure for the bankruptcy
                              of government efforts to stabilize the economy. Every attempt to offset
                              inflation or unemployment through nationwide tax rebates or hikes, or
                              through monetary or credit manipulation, or through other uniform,
                              undifferenti-ated policies, merely aggravates the disease.

                              Those who attempt to manage Third Wave economies with such
                              centralized Second Wave tools are like a doctor who arrives at a
                              hospital one morning and blindly prescribes the same shot of Adrenalin
                              for all patients—regardless of whether they have a broken leg, a
                              ruptured spleen, a brain tumor, or an ingrown toenail. Only
                              disaggregated, increas-

                              economy, for it, too, is becoming progressively decentralized at the
                              very moment it seems most global and uniform.

                              All these anti-centralist tendencies—in politics, in corporate or
                              government organization, and in the economy itself (reinforced by
                              parallel developments hi the media, in the distribution of computer
                              power, in energy systems, and in many other fields)—are creating a
                              wholly new society and making yesterday's rules obsolete.

                              Many other sections of the Second Wave social code are also being
                              drastically rewritten as the Third Wave arrives. Thus Second Wave
                              civilization's obsessive emphasis on maximization is also under sharp
                              attack. Never before have advocates of Bigger Is Better been so
                              assailed by advocates of Small Is Beautiful. It was only in the 1970's
                              that a book with that title could have become an influential, worldwide
                              best seller.]]></page><page Index="212"><![CDATA[Everywhere we are seeing a dawning recognition that there are limits
                              to the much-vaunted economies of scale and that many organizations
                              have exceeded those limits. Corporations are now actively searching
                              for ways to reduce the size of their work units. New technologies and
                              the shift to services both sharply reduce the scale of operation. The
                              traditional Second Wave factory or office, with thousands of people
                              under a single roof, will be a rarity in the high-technology nations.

                              In Australia, when I asked the president of an auto company to
                              describe the auto plant of the future, he spoke with. utter conviction,
                              saying, "I would never, ever again build a plant like this one with seven
                              thousand workers under the same roof. I would break it into small
                              units—three hundred or four hundred in each. The new technologies
                              now make this possible." I have since heard similar sentiments from
                              the presidents or chairmen of companies producing food and many
                              other products.

                              Today, we are beginning to realize that neither big nor small is
                              beautiful, but that appropriate scale, and the intelligent meshing of both
                              big and small, is most beautiful of all. (This was something that E. F.
                              Schumacher, author of Small Is Beautiful, knew better than some of his

                              We are also beginning to experiment with new forms of organization
                              that combine the advantages of both. For example, the rapid spread of
                              franchising in the United States, Britain, Holland, and other countries is
                              often a response to capital shortage or tax quirks and can be criticized
                              on various grounds. But it represents a method for rapidly creating
                              small units and linking them together in larger systems, with varying
                              degrees of centralization or decentralization. It is an attempt to mesh
                              large- and small-scale organizations.

                              Second Wave maximization is on its way out. Appropriate scale is in.

                              Society is also taking a hard look at Second Wave sped zation and
                              professionalism. The Second Wave code book p experts on a towering
                              pedestal. One of its basic rules "Specialize to succeed." Today, in
                              every field, including politics, we see a basic change in attitude toward
                              the expert. Once regarded as the trustworthy source of neutral
                              intelligence, specialists have been dethroned from public approval.
                              They are increasingly criticized for pursuing their own self-interest and
                              for being incapable of anything but tunnel vision. We see more and
                              more efforts to restrain the power of the expert by adding laymen to
                              decision-making bodies—in hospitals, for example, and many other
                              institutions.

                              Second Wave civilization encouraged yet another principle:
                              concentration. It concentrated money, energy, resources, and; people.
                              It poured vast populations into urban concentrationsJ Today this
                              process, too, has begun to turn around. We see uw creasing

                              variety of more widely dispersed forms of energy and we are seeing

                              schools, hospitals, aa mental institutions.

                              In short, one could move systematically through the entire code book

                              specialization, and concentration—and show, item by item, how the old
                              ground rules that governed our daily lives and our social decision-
                              making are in the process of being revolutionized as Third Wave
                              civilization sweeps in.

                              THE ORGANIZATION OF THE FUTURE

                              Earlier we saw that when all the Second Wave principles were put to
                              work in a single organization the result was a classical industrial
                              bureaucracy: a giant, hierarchical, permanent, top-down, mechanistic
                              organization, well designed for making repetitive products or repetitive
                              decisions in a comparatively stable industrial environment

                              Now, however, as we shift to the new principles and begin to apply
                              them together, we are necessarily led to wholly new kinds of
                              organizations for the future. These Third Wave organizations have
                              flatter hierarchies. They are less top-heavy. They consist of small
                              components linked together in temporary configurations. Each of these
                              components has its own relationships with the outside world, its own
                              foreign policy, so to speak, which it maintains without having to go
                              through the center. These organizations operate more and more
                              around the clock.

                              But they are different from bureaucracies in another fundamental
                              respect. They are what might be called "dual" or "poly" organizations,
                              capable of assuming two or more distinct structural shapes as
                              conditions warrant—rather like some plastic of the future that will
                              change shape when heat or cold is applied but spring back into a basic
                              form when the temperature is in its normal range.

                              One might imagine an army that is democratic and participatory in
                              peace time but highly centralized and authoritarian during war, having
                              been organized, in the first place, to be capable of both. We might use
                              the analogy of a football team whose members are not merely capable
                              of rearranging them-nelves in T formation and numerous other
                              arrangements for different plays but who, at the sound of a whistle, are]]></page><page Index="214"><![CDATA[equally capable of reassembling themselves as a soccer, baseball, or

                              organizational structures and roles.

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              We need managers who can operate as capably in an open-door, free-
                              flow style as in a hierarchical mode, who can work in an organization
                              structured like an Egyptian pyramid ' as well as in one that looks like a
                              Calder mobile, with a few thin managerial strands holding a complex
                              set of nearly autonomous modules that move in response to the
                              gentlest breeze.

                              We do not yet have a vocabulary for describing these organizations of
                              the future. Terms like matrix or ad hoc are inadequate. Various
                              theorists have suggested different words. Advertising man Lester
                              Wunderman has said, "Ensemble groups, acting as intellectual
                              commandos, will . . . begin to replace the hierarchial structure." Tony
                              Judge, one of our most brilliant organization theorists, has written
                              extensively about the "network" character of these emerging
                              organizations of the future, pointing out, among other things, that "the
                              network is not 'coordinated* by anybody; the participating 'bodies
                              coordinate themselves so that one may speak of 'auto- ; coordination.'"
                              Elsewhere he has described them in terms Buckminster Fuller's
                              "tensegrity" principles.

                              But whatever terms we use, something revolutionary happening. We
                              are participating not merely in the birth o new organizational forms but
                              in the birth of a new civiliz tion. A new code book is taking form—a set
                              of Third Wave principles, fresh ground-rules for social survival.

                              It is hardly any wonder that parents—still mainly tied to the industrial-
                              era code book—find themselves hi conflict with children who, aware of
                              the growing irrelevance of the oldj rules, are uncertain, if not blindly
                              ignorant, of the new ones.] They and we alike are caught between a
                              dying Second Wave* order and the Third Wave civilization of
                              tomorrow.


                              THE RISE OF THE PROSUMER

                              Giant historical shifts are sometimes symbolized by minute changes in
                              everyday behavior. One such change—its significance all but
                              overlooked—occurred early in the 1970's when a new product began
                              invading the pharmacies of France, England, Holland, and other
                              European countries. The new product was a do-it-yourself pregnancy
                              test kit. Within a few years an estimated 15 to 20 million such kits had
                              been sold to European women. Soon ads in American newspapers
                              were clamoring: "Pregnant? The sooner you know, the better." When
                              Warner-Lambert, an American firm, introduced the kit under its brand
                              name it found the response "overwhelmingly good." By 1980 millions of]]></page><page Index="215"><![CDATA[women on both sides of the Atlantic were routinely performing for

                              They were not the only ones sidestepping the physician. According to
                              Medical World News, "Self-care—the idea that people can and should
                              be more medically self-reliant—is a fast rolling new bandwagon. . . .

                              smears, even carry out elementary surgical procedures."

                              Today mothers are taking throat cultures. Schools offer courses on
                              everything from foot care to "instant pediatrics." And people are

                              market is destined for the home. Sales of otoscopes, ear-cleaning
                              devices, nose and throat irrigators, and specialized convalescent
                              products are all booming, as individuals take on more responsibility for
                              their own health, reduce the number of visits to the doctor, and cut
                              short their hospital stays.

                              On the surface all this might seem no more than a fad. Yet this rush to
                              treat one's own problems (instead of paying someone else to do so)
                              reflects a substantial change hi our values, in our definition of illness,
                              and in our perception of body and self. Even this explanation, however,
                              diverts attention from a still larger meaning. To appreciate the truly
                              historic significance of this phenomenon, we need to glance briefly
                              backward.

                              THE INVISIBLE ECONOMY

                              During the First Wave most people consumed what they themselves
                              produced. They were neither producers nor consumers in the usual
                              sense. They were instead what might be called "prosumers."

                              It was the industrial revolution, driving a wedge into society, that
                              separated these two functions, thereby giving birth to what we now call
                              producers and consumers. This split led to the rapid spread of the
                              market or exchange network—that maze of channels through which
                              goods or services, produced by you, reach me and vice versa.

                              Earlier I argued that, with the Second Wave, we went from an
                              agricultural society based on "production for use"—an economy of
                              prosumers, as it were—to an industrial society based on "production
                              for exchange." The actual situation was more complicated, however.]]></page><page Index="216"><![CDATA[For just as a small amount of production for exchange—i.e., for the
                              market—existed during the First Wave, there continued to be a small
                              amount of production for self-use during the Second.

                              A more revealing way of thinking about the economy, therefore, is to
                              think of it as having two sectors. Sector A comprises all that unpaid
                              work done directly by people for themselves, their families, or their
                              communities. Sector B comprises all the production of goods or
                              services for sale or swap through the exchange network or market.

                              Seen this way, we can now say that during the First Wave, Sector A—
                              based on production for use—was enormous, while Sector B was
                              minimal. During the Second Wave the re-

                              267

                              verse was true. In fact, the production of goods and services for the
                              market mushroomed to such an extent that Second Wave economists
                              virtually forgot the existence of Sector A. The very word "economy"
                              was defined to exclude all forms of work or production not intended for
                              the market, and the prosumer became invisible.

                              This meant, for example, that all the unpaid work done by women in
                              the home, all the cleaning, scrubbing, child-rearing, the community
                              organizing, was contemptuously dismissed as "non-economic," even
                              though Sector B—the visible economy —could not have existed
                              without the goods and services produced in Sector A—the invisible
                              economy. If no one were at home minding the children there would be
                              no next generation of paid workers for Sector B, and the system would
                              fall of its own weight

                              Can anyone imagine a functional economy, let alone a highly
                              productive one, without workers who, as children, have been toilet
                              trained, taught to speak, and socialized into the culture? What would
                              happen to the productivity of Sector B if the workers flowing into it
                              lacked even these minimal skills? Though ignored by Second Wave
                              economists, the fact is that the productivity of each sector depends
                              heavily on the other.

                              Today, as Second Wave societies suffer their terminal crisis, politicians
                              and experts still bandy about economic statistics based entirely on
                              Sector B transactions. They worry about declining "growth" and
                              "productivity." Yet so long as they continue to think in Second Wave
                              categories, so long as they ignore Sector A and regard it as outside the
                              economy— and so long as the prosumer remains invisible—they will
                              never be able to manage our economic affairs.

                              For if we look closely we find the beginnings of a fundamental shift in
                              the relationship of these two sectors or forms of production to one
                              another. We see a progressive blurring of the line that separates
                              producer from consumer. We see the rising significance of the
                              prosumer. And beyond that, we see an awesome change looming that
                              will transform even the role of the market itself in our lives and in the
                              world system.]]></page><page Index="217"><![CDATA[All this takes us back to the millions of people who are beginning to

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              the visible economy that the economists monitor to the phantom
                              economy they have forgotten.

                              They are "presuming." And they are not alone.

                              OVEREATERS AND WIDOWS

                              In Britain hi 1970, a Manchester housewife named Kather-ine Fisher,
                              after suffering for years from a desperate fear of leaving her own
                              home, founded an organization for others with similar phobias. Today
                              that organization, The Phobics Society, has many branches and is one
                              of thousands of new groups cropping up in many of the high-
                              technology nations to help people deal directly with their own
                              problems—psychological, medical, social, or sexual.

                              In Detroit, some 50 "bereavement groups" have sprung up to aid
                              people suffering from grief after the loss of a relative or friend. In
                              Australia an organization called GROW brings together former mental
                              patients and "nervous persons." GROW now has chapters in Hawaii,
                              New Zealand, and Ireland. In 22 states an organization called Parents
                              of Gays and Lesbians is in formation to help those with homosexual
                              children. In Britain, Depressives Associated has some 60 chapters.
                              From Addicts Anonymous and the Black Lung Association to Parents
                              Without Partners and Widow-to-Widow, new groups are forming
                              everywhere.

                              Of course, there is nothing new about people in trouble getting
                              together to talk out their problems and learn from one another.
                              Nonetheless, historians can find little precedent for the wildfire speed
                              with which the self-help movement is spreading today.

                              Frank Riessman and Alan Gartner, co-directors of the New Human
                              Services Institute, estimate mat hi the United States alone there are
                              now over 500,000 such groupings—about one for every 435 in the
                              population—with new ones forming daily. Many are short-lived, but for
                              each, one that disappears several seem to take its place.

                              These organizations vary widely. Some share the new suspicion of
                              specialists and attempt to work without them. They rely entirely on
                              what might be termed "cross-counseling"— people swapping advice
                              based on then* own life experience, as distinct from receiving
                              traditional counseling from the professionals. Some see themselves as
                              providing a support system for people hi trouble. Others play a political
                              role,

                              lobbying for changes in legislation or tax regulations. Still others have a
                              quasi-religious character. Some are intentional communities whose
                              members not only meet but actually live together.

                              Such groups are now forming regional, even transnational linkages. To
                              the extent that professional psychologists, social workers, or doctors
                              are involved at all, they increasingly undergo a role change, shifting
                              from the role of impersonal expert who is assumed to know best to that
                              of listener, teacher, ;md guide who works with the patient or client.
                              Existing voluntary or nonprofit groups—originally organized for the
                              purpose of helping others—are similarly struggling to see how they fit
                              in with a movement based on the principle of helping oneself.

                              The self-help movement is thus restructuring the socio-sphere.
                              Smokers, stutterers, suicide-prone people, gamblers, victims of throat
                              disease, parents of twins, overeaters, and other such groupings now
                              form a dense network of organizations that mesh with the emerging
                              Third Wave family and corporate structures.

                              But whatever their significance for social organization, they represent a
                              basic shift from passive consumer to active pro-sumer, and they thus
                              hold economic meaning as well. Though ultimately dependent on the
                              market and still intertwined with it, they are transferring activity from
                              Sector B of the economy to Sector A, from the exchange sector to the
                              pro-sumption sector. Nor is this burgeoning movement the only such
                              force: Some of the richest and largest corporations in the world are
                              also—for their own technological and economic reasons—accelerating
                              the rise of the prosumer.

                              THE DO-IT-YOURSELFERS

                              In 1956 the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, creaking
                              under the burden of exploding communications demand, began
                              introducing new electronic technology that made it possible for callers
                              to direct-dial their long-distance calls. Today it is even possible to
                              direct-dial many overseas calls. By punching in the appropriate
                              numbers, the consumer took on a task previously done for him by the
                              operator.

                              In 1973-74 the oil squeeze triggered by the Arab embargo sent
                              gasoline prices soaring. Giant oil companies reaped bonanza profits,
                              but local filling-station operators had to fight

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              a desperate battle for economic survival. To cut costs many introduced
                              self-service fuel pumps. At first these were an oddity. Newspapers
                              wrote funny feature stories about the motorist who tried to put the fuel
                              hose into the car radiator. Soon, however, the sight of consumers
                              pumping their own gas became a commonplace.]]></page><page Index="219"><![CDATA[Only 8 percent of U.S. gas stations were on a self-service basis in
                              1974. By 1977 the number reached nearly 50 percent. In West
                              Germany, of 33,500 service stations some 15 percent had shifted to
                              self-service by 1976, and this 15 percent accounted for 35 percent of
                              all the gasoline sold. Industry experts say that it will soon be 70
                              percent of the total. Once more the consumer is replacing a producer
                              and becoming a prosumer.

                              The same period saw the introduction of electronic banking, which not
                              only began to break down the pattern of "banker's hours" but also
                              increasingly eliminated the teller, leaving the customer to perform
                              operations previously done by the bank staff.

                              Getting the customer to do part of the job—known to economists as
                              "externalizing labor cost"—is scarcely new. That's what self-service
                              supermarkets are all about. The smiling clerk who knew the stock and
                              went and got it for you was replaced by the push-it-yourself shopping
                              cart. While some customers lamented the good old days of personal
                              service, many liked the new system. They could do their own
                              searching and they wound up paying a few cents less. In effect, they
                              were paying themselves to do the work the clerk had previously done.

                              Today this same form of externalization is occurring in many other
                              fields. The rise of discount stores, for example, represents a partial
                              step in the same direction. Clerks are far and few between; the
                              customer pays a bit less but works a bit harder. Even shoe stores, in
                              which a supposedly skilled clerk was long regarded as a necessity, are
                              moving to self-service, shifting work to the consumer.

                              The same principle can be found elsewhere, too. As Caroline Bird has
                              written in her perceptive book, The Crowding Syndrome, "More things
                              come knocked down for supposedly easy assembly at home . . . and
                              during the Christmas season shoppers in some of the proudest old
                              New York stores have to make out sales slips for clerks unable or
                              unwilling to write."

                              In January 1978 a thirty-year-old government worker in

                              THE RISE OF THE PROSUMER

                              271

                              Washington, D.C., heard strange noises emanating from his
                              refrigerator. The customary thing to do in the past was to call in a
                              mechanic and pay him to fix it. Given the high cost and (he difficulty of
                              getting a repairman at a convenient hour, Barry Nussbaum read the
                              instructions that came with his refrigerator. On it he discovered an 800
                              telephone number that he could use to call the manufacturer—
                              Whirlpool Corporation of Benton Harbor, Michigan—free of charge.

                              This was the "Cool-Line" set up by Whirlpool to help customers with
                              service problems. Nussbaum called. The man at the other end then
                              "talked him through" a repair, explaining to Nussbaum exactly which
                              bolts to remove, which sounds to listen for and—later—what part
                              would be needed. "That guy," says Nussbaum, "was super-helpful. He]]></page><page Index="220"><![CDATA[not only knew what I needed to do, he was a great confidence builder."
                              The refrigerator was fixed in no time.

                              Whirlpool has a bank of nine full-time and several part-time advisers,
                              some of them former service field men, who wear headsets and take
                              such calls. A screen in front of them Instantly displays for them a
                              diagram of whatever product is Involved (Whirlpool makes freezers,
                              dishwashers, air-conditioners, and other appliances in addition to
                              refrigerators) and permits them to guide the customer. In 1978 alone
                              Whirlpool lumdled 150,000 such calls.

                              The Cool-Line is a rudimentary model for a future system of
                              maintenance that permits the homeowner to do much of what a paid
                              outside mechanic or specialist once did. Made possible by advances
                              that have driven down the cost of longdistance telephoning, it suggests
                              future systems that might ac-I Inally display step-by-step fix-it-yourself
                              instructions on the home television screen as the adviser speaks. The
                              spread of mich systems would reserve the repair mechanic only for
                              major tasks, or turn the mechanic (like the doctor or social worker) into
                              a teacher, guide, and guru for prosumers.

                              What we see is a pattern that cuts across many indus-iiirs—increasing
                              externalization, increasing involvement of I ili«v consumer in tasks
                              once done for her or him by others— nnd once again, therefore, a
                              transfer of activity from Sector It of the economy to Sector A, from the
                              exchange sector to iln' prosumption sector.

                              All of this pales by comparison with what we see when we

                              chipped flagstones. Nothing new about that. What's changed—and
                              changed astonishingly—is the relationship between the do-it-yourselfer
                              and the professional builder, carpenter, electrician, plumber, or what
                              have you.

                              As recently as ten years ago in the United States only 3( percent of all
                              electric power tools were sold to do-it-yoursel ers; 70 percent went to
                              carpenters or other professioi craftsmen. In a short ten years those
                              figures have been versed: Today only 30 percent are sold to
                              professionals; 70 percent are bought by consumers who, more and
                              mot are doing-it-themselves.

                              An even more significant milestone, according to Frost Sullivan, a
                              leading industrial research firm, was passed in United States between
                              1974 and 1976, when "for the time, more than half of all building
                              materials . . . were pi chased directly by homeowners rather than by
                              contractors dc ing work for them." And this did not include an]]></page><page Index="221"><![CDATA[additionalj $350,000,000 spent by the home craftsman for jobs costing]

                              change, declares the F & S report, is "bot dramatic and continuing."

                              Another Frost & Sullivan study speaks of the "skyrocketii growth of
                              such expenditures and underscores the value shil toward self-
                              sufficiency. "Where working with one's hands looked down upon (at
                              least by the middle class) it is now sign of pride. People doing their
                              own work are proud of it."

                              Schools, universities, and publishers are busy offering at avalanche of
                              how-to courses and books. Says U.S. News & World Report: "Both rich
                              and poor are caught up hi boom. In Cleveland, home-repair instruction
                              is offered public-housing projects. In California, owner-installed saum
                              spas and decks are popular."

                              In Europe, too, the so-called "DIY revolution" is way—with a few
                              variations based on national temperamer (German and Dutch do-it-

                              leisure. All these play a part. A more potent reason, however, is what
                              might be called the Law of Relative Inefficiency. This holds that the
                              more we automate the production (if goods and lower their per-unit
                              cost, the more we increase (lie relative cost of handcrafts and
                              nonautomated services. (If a plumber gets $20 for a one-hour house
                              call and $20 will buy one hand calculator, his price, in effect, goes up
                              substan-(i.illy when the same $20 will buy several hand calculators.
                              Relative to the cost of other goods, his price has risen several limes
                              over.)

                              For such reasons, we must expect the price of many services to
                              continue their skyrocketing climb in the years ahead. And as these
                              prices soar, we can expect people to do more nnd more for
                              themselves. In short, even without inflation, the Law of Relative
                              Inefficiency would make it increasingly "profitable" for people to
                              produce for their own consumption, thus transferring further activity
                              from Sector B to Sector A of the economy, from exchange production
                              to presumption.

                              To glimpse the long-range future of this development, we need to look
                              not only at services, but at goods. And when we do we find that here,]]></page><page Index="222"><![CDATA[too, the consumer is increasingly being drawn into the production
                              process.

                              Thus eager manufacturers today recruit—even pay—customers to help
                              design products. This is not merely true in industries that sell direct to
                              the public—food, soap, toiletries, et cetera—but even more so in the
                              advanced industries like elec-l ronics where de-massification is most
                              rapid.

                              "We've been most successful when we have worked closely with one
                              or two customers," says the manager of Texas Instruments' planning
                              system. "To go off and study an application by ourselves and then try
                              to come up with a standard product in that market has not been
                              successful."

                              Indeed, Cyril H. Brown of Analog Devices, Inc. divides all products into
                              two kinds: "inside-out" products and "outside-in" products. The latter
                              are defined not by the manufacturer hut by the potential customer, and
                              these outsider products, uccording to Brown, are ideal. The more we
                              shift toward advanced manufacture, and the more we de-massify and

                              production process must necessarily grow.

                              Today members of Computer-aided Manufacturing International (CAM-
                              I) are hard at work classifying and coding parts and processes to
                              permit the full automation of production. The prospect is still no more
                              than a glint in the eye of such experts as Professor Inyong Ham of
                              Penn State's Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems
                              Engineer ing, but ultimately a customer will be able to feed his or her
                              specifications into a manufacturer's computer directly.

                              The computer will not only design the product the cus tomer wants,
                              Professor Ham explains, but select the manufactoring processes to be
                              used. It will assign the machines. It will sequence the necessary steps
                              from, say, milling or grind ing right down to painting. It will write the
                              necessary programs for the subcomputers or numerical control devices
                              that will run the machines. And it may even feed in an "adaptive
                              control" that will optimize these various processes for both economic
                              and environmental purposes.

                              In the end, the consumer, not merely providing the specs but punching
                              the button that sets this entire process in action will become as much a
                              part of the production process as the denim-clad assembly-line worker
                              was in the world now dying.

                              While such a customer-activated manufacturing system is still some
                              distance off, at least some of the hardware already exists. Thus, at

                              Robert H. Anderson, head of the Information Services Department at

                              Namely, you'll be sitting there doing things like designing a suit of

                              the computers can cut one for you by laser and sew it together for you
                              by numerically controlled machine.. ..

                              "You really could, because of the computers, take your specs and turn

                              and all the physics of the situation so they won't let you get too far out
                              of bounds."

                              And if to this we now add the possibility that many people may soon be
                              working at home anyway in the electronic cot-tages of tomorrow, we
                              begin to imagine a significant change in the "tools" available to the
                              consumer. Many of the same electronic devices we will use in the
                              home to do work for pay will also make it possible to produce goods or
                              services for our own use. In this system the prosumer, who dominated
                              in First Wave societies, is brought back into the center of economic
                              action—but on a Third Wave, high-technology basis.

                              In short, whether we look at self-help movements, do-it-yourself trends,
                              or new production technologies, we find the same shift toward a much
                              closer involvement of the consumer in production. In such a world,
                              conventional distinctions between producer and consumer vanish. The
                              "outsider" becomes an "insider," and even more production is shifted
                              from Sector B of the economy to Sector A where the pro-sumer reigns.

                              As this occurs we begin—glacially at first but then, perhaps, with
                              accelerating speed—to alter that most fundamental of our institutions:
                              the market.

                              PROSUMER LIFE-STYLES

                              The willing seduction of the consumer into production has staggering
                              implications. To understand why, it helps to remember that the market
                              is premised on precisely the split between producer and consumer that
                              is now being blurred. An elaborate market was not necessary when
                              most people consumed what they themselves produced. It only
                              became necessary when the task of consumption was separated from
                              that of production.

                              Conventional writers define the market narrowly as a capi-talist,
                              money-based phenomenon. Yet the market is merely mother word for
                              an exchange network, and there have been (and still are) many]]></page><page Index="224"><![CDATA[different kinds of exchange networks. In the West the most familiar to
                              us is the profit-based, capitalist market. But there are also socialist
                              markets—exchange networks through which the goods or services
                              produced by Ivan Ivanovich in Smolensk are traded for goods or
                              services turned out by Johann Schmidt in East Berlin. There are

                              276 THE THIRD WAVE

                              markets based on money—but also markets based on barter. The
                              market is neither capitalist nor socialist. It is a direct, inescapable
                              consequence of the divorce of producer from consumer. Wherever this
                              divorce occurs the market arises. And wherever the gap between
                              consumer and producer narrows, the entire function, role, and power of
                              the market is brought into question.

                              The rise of presuming today, therefore, begins to change the role of
                              the market in our lives.

                              It is too early to know where this subtle but significant thrust is taking
                              us. Certainly the market is not going to go away. We are not going to
                              go back to premarket economies. What I have called Sector B—the
                              exchange sector—is not going to shrivel up and vanish. We will, for a
                              long time to come, continue to be heavily dependent upon the market.

                              Nevertheless, the rise of presuming points strongly toward a
                              fundamental change hi the relationships between Sector A and Sector
                              B—a set of relationships that Second Wave economists have until now
                              virtually ignored.

                              For presuming involves the "de-marketization" of at least certain
                              activities and therefore a sharply altered role for the market in society.
                              It suggests an economy of the future unlike any we have known—an
                              economy that is no longer lopsidedly weighted in favor of either Sector
                              A or Sector B. It points to the emergence of an economy that will
                              resemble neither First Wave nor Second Wave economies, but will, in-
                              stead, fuse the characteristics of both into a new historic syn thesis.

                              The rise of the prosumer, powered by the soaring cost of many paid
                              services, by the breakdown of Second Wave ser-vice bureaucracies,
                              by the availability of Third Wave technol-ogies, by the problems of
                              structural unemployment, and by many other converging factors, leads
                              to new work-styles and life arrangements. If we permit ourselves to
                              speculate, bear-I ing in mind some of the shifts described earlier—such
                              as the move toward de-synchronization and part-time paid work, the
                              possible emergence of the electronic cottage, or the changed structure
                              of family life—we can begin to discern some of these life-style
                              changes.

                              Thus we are moving toward a future economy in which very large
                              numbers never hold full-time paid jobs, or in which "full-time" is
                              redefined, as it has been in recent years, to mean a shorter and
                              shorter workweek or work year. (In

                              Large numbers of workers already do paid work for what averages out
                              to only three or four days a week, or they take six months or a year off
                              to pursue educational or recreational goals. This pattern may well grow
                              stronger as two-paycheck households multiply. More people in the paid
                              labor market—higher "labor participation rates," as the economists put
                              it—may very well go with reduced hours per worker.

                              This casts the whole question of leisure into a new light. Once we
                              recognize that much of our so-called leisure time is, in fact, spent
                              producing goods and services for our own use—presuming—then the
                              old distinction between work and leisure falls apart. The question is not
                              work versus leisure, but paid work for Sector B versus unpaid, self-
                              directed, and self-monitored work for Sector A.

                              In the Third Wave context new life-styles based half on production for
                              exchange, half on production for use, become practical. Such life-
                              styles were, in fact, common in the early days of the industrial
                              revolution among farm populations who were slowly being absorbed
                              into the urban proletariat. For a long transitional period millions of
                              people worked part-time in factories and part-time on the land, growing
                              their own food, buying some of their necessities, making the rest. This
                              pattern still prevails in many parts of the world—but usually on a
                              technologically primitive basis.

                              Imagine this life pattern—but with twenty-first century technology for
                              goods and food production, as well as immensely enhanced self-help
                              methods for the production of many services. Instead of a dress
                              pattern, for example, tomorrow's prosumer might well buy a cassette
                              with a program on it that will drive a "smart" electronic sewing machine.
                              Even the clumsiest househusband, with such a cassette, could make
                              his own custom-fitted shirts. Mechanically inclined tinkerers could do
                              more than tune up their autos. They could actually half-build them.

                              We saw that it "may become possible some day for the customer to
                              program his or her own specifications into the auto manufacturing
                              process via computer and telephone. But there is another way in which
                              the consumer, even now, can participate in producing an auto.

                              A company called Bradley Automotive already offers a "Bradley GT kit"
                              that lets you "put together your own luxurious sports car." The
                              prosumer who buys the partly preas-sembled kit mounts the fiberglass
                              body on a Volkswagen chassis, connects the engine wires, sets up the
                              steering, plugs in the seats, and so on.

                              One can easily picture a generation brought up on part-time paid work
                              as the norm, eager to use their own hands, equipped with many cheap
                              mini-technologies in the home, forming a sizable segment of the]]></page><page Index="226"><![CDATA[population. Half in the market, half out, working intermittently rather
                              than all year round, taking a year off now and then, they might well
                              earn less—but compensate by supplying their own labor for many
                              tasks that now cost money, thus mitigating the effects of inflation.

                              America's Mormons offer another clue to possible future life-styles.
                              Many Mormon stakes—a stake corresponds to, say, a Catholic
                              diocese—own and operate their own farms. Members of the stake,
                              including urban members, spend some of their free time as volunteer
                              farmers growing food. Most of the produce is not sold but stored for
                              emergency use or distributed to Mormons in need. There are central
                              canning plants, bottling facilities, and grain elevators. Some Mormons
                              grow their own food and take it to the cannery. Others actually buy
                              fresh vegetables at the supermarket, then take them to the local
                              cannery.

                              Says a Salt Lake City Mormon, "My mother will buy tomatoes and can
                              them. Her relief 'society,' the women's auxiliary society, will have a day
                              and they'll all go and can tomatoes for their own use." Similarly, many
                              Mormons not only contribute money to their church but actually
                              perform volunteer labor—construction work, for example.

                              None of this is to suggest that we are all going to become members of
                              the Mormon church, or that it will be possible in the future to re-create
                              on a wide scale the social and community bonds one finds in this
                              highly participatory yet theologically autocratic group. But the principle
                              of production for self-use, either by individuals or by organized groups,
                              is likely to spread farther.

                              and less market-intensive than those that typified Second Wave
                              civilization.

                              It is still too early to know how far this shift of activity from exchange in
                              Sector B to presumption in Sector A will go, how the balance between
                              these sectors will vary from country to country, and which particular
                              life-styles will actually emerge from it. What is certain, however, is that
                              any significant change in the balance between production for use and
                              production for exchange will set off depth charges under our economic
                              system and our values as well.

                              promoted hard work. Western executives mutter darkly about this
                              "English disease" which is supposed to reduce us all to penury if we do
                              not cure it. "Only the Japanese still work hard," they say. But I have
                              heard top leaders of Japanese industry say that their labor force is
                              suffering from the same infection. "Only the South Koreans work hard,"
                              they say.

                              Yet the very people who are supposedly unwilling to work hard on the
                              job are often the same people who are, in fact, working hard off the
                              job—laying bathroom tile, weaving carpets, lending their time and
                              talents to a political campaign, attending self-help meetings, sewing,
                              growing vegetables in the garden, writing short stories, or remodeling
                              the attic bedroom. Can it be that the driving motivation that powered
                              the expansion of Sector B is now being channeled into Sector A—into
                              presuming?

                              The Second Wave brought with it more than steam engines and
                              mechanical looms. It brought with it an immense charac-terological
                              change. Today we can still see this shift occurring among .populations
                              moving from First Wave to Second Wave societies—like the Koreans,
                              for example, who are still busy expanding Sector B at the expense of
                              Sector A.

                              we will explore this fascinating change. For now we need only bear in
                              mind that the structure of personality itself is likely to be heavily
                              influenced by the rise of prosumption.

                              Nowhere, however, are the changes wrought by the rise of the
                              prosumer likely to be more explosive than in economics. Economists,
                              instead of training all their guns on Sector B, will have to develop a
                              new, more wholistic conception of an economy—will have to analyze
                              what happens in Sector A as well and learn how the two parts relate to
                              one another.

                              As the Third Wave has begun to restructure the world economy, the
                              economics profession has been savagely attacked for its inability to
                              explain what is happening. Its most sophisticated tools, including
                              computerized models and matrices, seem to tell us less and less about
                              how the economy really works. Indeed, many economists themselves
                              are concluding that conventional economic thought, both Western and
                              Marxist, is out of touch with a f ast-changing reality.

                              One key reason may be that, more and more, changes of great
                              significance lie outside Sector B—i.e., outside the entire exchange

                              for describing processes in Sector A and will have to rethink many root
                              assumptions in the light of the rise of the prosumer.

                              Once we recognize that powerful relationships link the measured
                              production (and productivity) in Sector B and the unmeasured
                              production (and productivity) in Sector A, the invisible economy, we are
                              compelled to redefine these terms. As early as the mid-1960's,
                              economist Victor Fuchs of the National Bureau of Economic Research
                              sensed the problem, pointing out that the rise of services made
                              traditional measures of productivity obsolete. Declared Fuchs: "The
                              knowledge, experience, honesty, and motivation of the consumer
                              affects service productivity."

                              But even in these words the "productivity" of the consumer Is still seen
                              only in terms of Sector B—only as a contribution to production for
                              exchange. There is no recognition as yet that actual production also
                              takes place in Sector A—that goods and services produced for oneself
                              are quite real, and that they may displace or substitute for goods and
                              services turned out in Sector B. Conventional production figures,
                              especially GNP figures, will make less and less sense until we
                              explicitly expand them to include what happens in Sector A.

                              THE RISE OF THE PROSUMER

                              281



                              An understanding of the rise of the prosumer also helps bring the
                              concept of cost into sharper focus. Thus we gain powerful insights
                              once we recognize that the effectiveness of the prosumer in Sector A
                              can lead to higher or lower costs to companies or government
                              agencies operating in Sector B.

                              For example, high rates of alcoholism, absenteeism, nervous
                              breakdowns, and mental disorder in the work force all add to the "cost
                              of doing business" as measured conveniently in Sector B. (Alcoholism
                              alone has been estimated to cost American industry $20 billion in
                              production time a year. In Poland or the Soviet Union, where this
                              disease is, if anything, more widespread, the comparable figures must
                              be even more appalling.) To the degree that self-help groups alleviate
                              such problems in the work force, they reduce these operating costs.
                              The efficiency of presumption thus affects the efficiency of production.

                              Subtler factors also influence the cost of production in business. How
                              literate or articulate are the workers? Do they all speak the same
                              language? Can they tell time? Are they culturally prepared for the job?
                              Do the social skills learned in family life add to or detract from their
                              competence? All these character traits, attitudes, values, skills, and
                              motivations necessary for high productivity in Sector B, the exchange
                              sector, are produced or, more accurately, presumed in Sector A. The
                              rise of the prosumer—the reintegration of the consumer into
                              production—will force us to look far more closely at such
                              interrelationships.]]></page><page Index="229"><![CDATA[The same powerful change will compel us to redefine efficiency.
                              Today, in determining efficiency, economists compare alternative ways
                              of producing the same product or service. They seldom compare the
                              efficiency of producing it in Sector B as against that of presuming it in
                              Sector A. Yet this is precisely what millions of people—supposedly
                              innocent of economic theory—are doing. They are finding that, once a

                              more cash.

                              Nor do economists or businessmen systemically track the negative
                              effects of Sector B efficiency on Sector A—as for example when a
                              company demands extremely high mobility of its executives and
                              causes a wave of stress-related illness, family breakdown, or
                              increased alcohol intake as a result. We may very well find that what
                              appears to be inefficient in con-

                              ventional Sector B terms is, in fact, tremendously efficient when we
                              look at the whole economy and not just part of it.

                              To make sense, "efficiency" must refer to secondary, not merely first
                              order, effects, and to both sectors of the economy, not just one.

                              What about concepts like "income," "welfare," "poverty," or
                              "unemployment"? If a person lives half-in and half-out of the market
                              system, which products, tangible or intangible, are to be regarded as
                              part of his or her income? How meaningful are income figures at all hi
                              a society in which presuming may account for much of what the
                              average person has?

                              How do we define welfare hi such a system? Should welfare recipients
                              work? If so, should all this work necessarily be in Sector B? Or should
                              welfare recipients be encouraged to presume?

                              What is the real meaning of unemployment? Is a laid-off auto worker
                              who puts a new roof on his house, or overhauls his car, unemployed in
                              the same sense as one who sits idly at home watching football on
                              television? The rise of the pro-sumer forces us to question our entire
                              way of looking at the twin problems of unemployment, on the one
                              hand, and bureaucratic waste and featherbedding, on the other.

                              Second Wave societies have attempted to cope with unemployment,
                              for example, by resisting technology, closing off immigration, creating
                              labor exchanges, increasing exports, decreasing imports, setting up
                              public works programs, cutting back on work hours, attempting to
                              increase labor mobility, deporting whole populations, and even waging
                              war to stimulate the economy. Yet the problem becomes more
                              complex and difficult every day.

                              Can it be that the problems of labor supply—both gluts and
                              shortages—can never be satisfactorily solved within the framework of
                              a Second Wave society, whether capitalist or socialist? By looking at]]></page><page Index="230"><![CDATA[the economy as a whole, rather than focusing exclusively on one part
                              of it, can we frame the problem in a new way that helps us solve it?

                              If production occurs in both sectors, if people are busy producing
                              goods and services for themselves in one sector and for others in a
                              different sector, how does this affect the argument over a guaranteed
                              minimum income for all? Typically, in Second Wave societies income
                              has been inextricably linked to work for the exchange economy. But

                              The rise of the prosumer will decisively alter all our economic thinking.
                              It will also shift the basis of economic conflict. The competition
                              between worker-producers and manager-producers will no doubt
                              continue. But it will shrink in importance as presuming increases and
                              we move farther into Third Wave society. In its place new social
                              conflicts will arise.

                              Battles will flare over which needs will be met by which sector of the
                              economy. Struggles will sharpen, for example, over licensing, building
                              codes, and the like, as Second Wave forces attempt to hold on to jobs
                              and profits by preventing prosumers from moving in. Teachers' unions
                              typically fight to keep parents out of the classroom with all the zeal of
                              building tradesmen fighting to preserve obsolete building codes. Yet
                              just as a number of health problems (like those deriving from
                              overeating, lack of exercise, or smoking, for example) cannot be
                              solved by doctors alone but require instead the active participation of
                              the patient, so a number of educational problems cannot be resolved
                              without the parent. The rise of the prosumer changes the entire
                              economic landscape.

                              Thus all these effects will be intensified and the entire world economy
                              changed by a massive historical fact now staring us in the face—which
                              seems to have gone unnoticed by Second Wave economists and
                              thinkers. This last towering fact sets into perspective all we have so far
                              read in this chapter.

                              THE END OF MARKETIZATION

                              What has gone almost unnoticed is not merely a change in Ihe
                              patterns of participation in the market but, even more fundamentally,
                              the completion of the entire historical process of market-building. This
                              turning point is so revolutionary in its implications, yet so subtle, that
                              capitalist and Marxist thinkers alike, lost in their Second Wave
                              polemics, have scarcely noticed its signs. It fits into neither of their

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              the past 300 years, ever since the Second Wave began, this process
                              has roared forward at very high speed. Second Wave civilization
                              "marketized" the world. Today—at the very moment when presuming
                              begins to rise again—this process is coming to an end.

                              The immense historical meaning of this cannot be appreciated unless
                              we are clear about what a market or exchange network is. It helps to
                              imagine it as a pipeline. When the industrial revolution burst forth on
                              the earth, launching the Second Wave, very few people on the planet
                              were tied into the money system. Trade existed but only the
                              peripheries of society were touched by it. The various networks of
                              jobbers, distributors, wholesalers, retailers, bankers, and other
                              elements of the trade system were small and rudimentary— providing
                              only a few narrow pipelines through which goods and money might
                              flow.

                              For 300 years we poured earth-cracking energies into building this
                              pipeline. It was accomplished in three ways. First the merchants and
                              mercenaries of Second Wave civilization spread around the globe,
                              inviting or coercing new populations to enter the market—to produce
                              more and presume less. Self-sufficient African tribesmen were induced
                              or compelled to grow cash crops and dig copper. Asian peasants who
                              once grew their own food were put to work on plantations instead,
                              tapping rubber trees to put tires on automobiles. Latin Americans
                              began growing coffee for sale hi Europe and the United States. With
                              each such development the pipeline was built or further elaborated and
                              more and more populations drawn into dependence on it.

                              The second way in which the market expanded was through the
                              increasing "commoditization" of life. Not only were larger populations
                              enmeshed in the market but more and more goods and services were
                              designed for the market, requiring a continual enlargement of the
                              "channel capacity" of the system—a widening, as it were, of the
                              diameter of the pipes.

                              Finally, the market expanded in another way. As society and the
                              economy grew more complex, the number of transac- I tions required
                              for, say, a single bar of soap to pass from producer to consumer
                              multiplied. The more intermediaries, the I more ramified the maze of
                              channels or pipes became. This growing elaborateness of the system
                              was itself a form of further development, like the addition of still more
                              special tubes and valves to a pipeline.

                              285

                              Today all these forms of market expansion are reaching their outer
                              limits. Few populations still remain to be brought into the market. Only]]></page><page Index="232"><![CDATA[a handful of the remotest people remain untouched by the market.
                              Even the hundreds of millions of subsistence farmers in poor countries
                              are at least partially integrated into the market and the accompanying
                              money system.

                              What remains, therefore, is a mopping-up operation at best. The
                              market can no longer expand by engulfing vast new populations.

                              The second form of expansion is still at least theoretically possible.
                              With imagination, we can still, no doubt, think up additional services or
                              goods to to sell or barter. But it is precisely here that the rise of the
                              prosumer becomes significant. The relationships between Sector A
                              and Sector B are complex, and many of the activities of prosumers
                              depend on the purchase of materials or took from the market. But the
                              rise of self-help, in particular, and the de-marketization of many goods
                              and services suggests that here, too, the end of the process of
                              marketization may be in sight

                              Lastly, the increasing elaborateness of the "pipeline"—the growing
                              complexity of distribution, the interpolation of more and more
                              middlemen—also appears to be reaching a point of no return. The
                              costs of exchange itself, even as conventionally measured, are now
                              outrunning the costs of material production in many fields. At some
                              point this process reaches a limit. Computers, meanwhile, and the
                              emergence of a pro-sumer-activated technology both point to smaller
                              inventories and simplified, rather than more complex, chains of
                              distribution. Once again, therefore, the evidence points to the end of
                              the process of marketization, if not in our time, then soon after.

                              If our "pipeline project" is nearing completion, what might (his mean for
                              our work, our values, and our psyches? A market, after all, does not
                              consist of the steel or shoes or cot-Ion or canned food that flows
                              through it. The market is the siructure through which such goods and
                              services are routed. Moreover, it is not simply an economic structure. It
                              is a way of organizing people, a way of thinking, an ethos, and a
                              •shared set of expectations (e.g., the expectation that goods
                              purchased will indeed be delivered). The market is thus as much a
                              psychological structure as an economic reality. And its (•fleets far

                              control over his or her destiny—no person, no nation, no culture. It
                              brought with it the belief that integration into the market was
                              "progressive" while self-sufficiency was "backward." It spread vulgar
                              materialism and the belief that economics and economic motivation
                              were the primary forces in human life. It fostered a view of life as a
                              succession of contractual transactions, and of society as bound
                              together by the "marriage contract" or the "social contract."]]></page><page Index="233"><![CDATA[Marketization thus shaped the thoughts and values, as well as the
                              actions, of billions and set the tone of Second Wave civilization.

                              It took an enormous investment of time, energy, capital, culture, and
                              raw materials to create a situation in which a purchasing agent in
                              South Carolina could do business with an unseen and unknown clerk
                              in South Korea—each with his or her own abacus or computer, each
                              with an internalized image of the market, each with a set of
                              expectations about the other, each performing certain predictable acts
                              because both have been life-trained to play certain prespecified roles,

                              planet, was the single most impressive achievement of Second Wave
                              civilization, dwarfing even its spectacular technological achievements.
                              The step-by-step creation of this essentially sociocultural and
                              psychological structure for exchange (quite apart from the torrent of
                              goods and services that flowed through it) can be likened to the
                              building of the Egyptian pyramids, the Roman aqueducts, the Chinese
                              wall, and the medieval cathedrals, combined and multiplied a
                              thousandfold.

                              This grandest construction project of all history, the laying into place of
                              the tubes and channels through which much ol the economic life of
                              civilization pulsed and flowed, gave Sec* ond Wave civilization
                              everywhere its inner dynamism and propulsive thrust. Indeed, if this
                              now dying civilization can be said to have had a mission at all, it was to
                              marketize t world.

                              Today that mission is all but fulfilled.

                              The heroic age of market-building is over—to be replaced by a new
                              phase in which we merely maintain, renovate, and update the pipeline.
                              We will undoubtedly have to redesign

                              information. The system will increasingly depend on electronics,
                              biology, and new social technologies. This, too, will no doubt require
                              resources, imagination, and capital. But compared with the exhausting
                              effort of Second Wave rnarketization, this renewal program will absorb
                              a far smaller fraction of our time, energy, capital, and imagination. It
                              will use less, not more, hardware and fewer, not more, people lhan the
                              original process of construction. However complex conversion proves
                              to be, marketization will no longer be the central project of the
                              civilization.

                              The Third Wave will therefore produce history's first "trans-market"
                              civilization.

                              that is dependent on the market but is no longer consumed by the
                              need to build, extend, elaborate, and integrate this structure. A
                              civilization able to move on to a new agenda—precisely because the
                              market has already been laid in place.

                              And just as no one living in the sixteenth century could have imagined
                              how the growth of the market would change the world's agenda in
                              terms of technology, politics, religion, art, social life, law, marriage, or
                              personality development—so too it is extremely difficult for us today to
                              envision the long-range effects of the end of marketization.

                              Yet these are likely to radiate into every cranny of our children's lives, if
                              not our own. The marketization project exacted a price. Even in purely
                              economic terms this price was enormous. As the productivity of the
                              human race rose during the past three hundred years, a significant part
                              of that productivity—in both sectors—was set aside and allocated to
                              the market-building project.

                              With the basic construction task now virtually complete, the enormous
                              energies previously poured into building the world market system

                              what is at stake is the role of the market in our lives and the future of
                              civilization itself.

                              This, at its core, is what the rise of the prosumer is about.

                              our information system, and our family and business institutions. These
                              are intertwined, hi turn, with the way we view the world. And in this
                              sphere, too, we are undergoing an historic upheaval. For the entire
                              world view of industrial civilization—indust-reality—is now being

                              with its scientific priesthood or ten-minute guru.

                              We see a mounting attack on establishment science. We see a wildfire
                              revival of fundamentalist religion and a desperate search for
                              something—almost anything—to believe in.

                              Much of this confusion is actually the result of an intensifying cultural
                              war—the collision of an emerging Third Wave culture with the
                              entrenched ideas and assumptions of industrial society. For just as the
                              Second Wave engulfed traditional views and spread the belief system I
                              call mdust-reality, so today we see the beginnings of a philosophical
                              revolt aimed at overthrowing the reigning assumptions of the past 300
                              years. The key ideas of the industrial period are being discredited,
                              discounted, superseded, or subsumed into much larger and moFe

                              The core beliefs of Second Wave civilization did not win acceptance
                              during the past three centuries without a bitter struggle. In science, in

                              "reactionary" thinkers who reflected and rationalized agricultural
                              societies. Today it is the defenders of industrialism who have their

                              form.

                              THE NEW IMAGE OF NATURE

                              Nothing illustrates this clash of ideas more clearly than our changing
                              image of nature.

                              In the past decade a worldwide environmental movement has sprung
                              up in response to fundamental, potentially dangerous changes in the
                              earth's biosphere. And this movement has done more than attack
                              pollution, food additives, nuclear reactors, highways, and hair-spray
                              aerosols. It has also forced us to rethink our dependency on nature. As
                              a consequence, instead of conceiving ourselves as engaged in a
                              bloody war with nature, we are moving toward a fresh view that
                              emphasizes symbiosis or harmony with the earth. We are shifting from
                              an adversary to a nonadversary posture.

                              At the scientific level, this has led to thousands of studies aimed at
                              understanding ecological relationships so that we can soften our
                              impacts on nature or channel them in constructive ways. We have just
                              begun to appreciate the complexity and dynamism of these
                              relationships and to reconceptualize society itself in terms of recycling,
                              renewability, and the carrying capacity of natural systems.]]></page><page Index="236"><![CDATA[All this is mirrored in a corresponding shift of popular attitudes toward
                              nature. Whether we examine opinion surveys or the lyrics of pop
                              songs, the visual imagery in advertising or the content of sermons, we
                              find evidence of a heightened, though often romantic, regard for
                              nature.

                              City dwellers by the millions yearn for the countryside, and the Urban

                              suspicion of technology is so widespread that even the most single-
                              minded pursuers of GNP today pay at least lip service to the idea that
                              nature must be protected, not raped—that the adverse side effects of
                              technology on nature must be anticipated and prevented, not simply
                              ignored.

                              THE MENTAL MAELSTROM

                              291

                              Because our power to damage it has escalated, the earth now is
                              regarded as far more fragile than Second Wave civilization suspected.
                              At the same time, it is seen as a diminishing dot in a universe that
                              grows larger and more complex with every passing moment.

                              Since the Third Wave began some 25 years ago, scientists have
                              developed a whole battery of new tools for probing nature's most
                              distant reaches. In turn these lasers, rockets, accelerators, plasmas,
                              fantastic photographic capabilities, computers, and colliding-beam
                              devices have burst our conception of what surrounds us.

                              We are now looking at phenomena that are bigger, smaller, and faster
                              by orders of magnitude than any we examined during the Second
                              Wave past. Today we are probing phenomena that are as tiny as
                              l/l,000,COO,000,000,OOOth of a centimeter in an explorable universe
                              whose edge lies at least 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 miles
                              away. We are studying phenomena so short-lived that they occur in
                              I/10,000,000,-000,000,000,000,000th of a second. By contrast, our
                              astronomers and cosmologists tell us the universe is some
                              20,000,000,000 years old. The sheer scale of explorable nature has
                              burst beyond yesterday's wildest assumptions.

                              Moreover, in this swirling vastness, we are told, the earth may not be
                              the only inhabited sphere. Says astronomer Otto Struve, "the vast
                              number of stars that must possess planets, the conclusions of many
                              biologists that life is an inherent property of certain types of
                              complicated molecules or aggregates of molecules, the uniformity
                              throughout the universe of the chemical elements, the light and heat
                              emitted by solar-type stars, and the occurrence of water not only on
                              the earth but on Mars and Venus, compel us to revise our thinking" and
                              consider the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

                              This doesn't mean little green humanoids. And it doesn't mean (or not
                              mean) UFOs. But by suggesting that life is not unique to the earth, it
                              further alters our perception of nature and our place in it. Since 1960,
                              scientists have been listening in the dark, hoping to detect signals from]]></page><page Index="237"><![CDATA[some distant intelligence. The United States Congress has held

                              gives us pause.

                              Our image of nature is not what it used to be.



                              DESIGNING EVOLUTION

                              Neither is our image of evolution—or, for that matter, evolution itself.

                              Biologists, archaeologists, and anthropologists, attempting to unravel
                              the mysteries of evolution, similarly find themselves in a bigger and
                              more complex world than previously imagined and are discovering that
                              laws once regarded as universal in application are actually special
                              cases.

                              Says the Nobel Prize-winning geneticist Francois Jacob, "Since
                              Darwin, biologists have gradually developed a ... chart of the
                              mechanism of evolution, called natural selection. On that basis
                              attempts have often been made to portray all evolution—cosmic,
                              chemical, cultural, ideological, social—as governed by a similar
                              selection mechanism. But such understandings seem doomed,
                              inasmuch as the rules change at every plane."

                              Even on the biological plane, rales once thought to apply across the
                              board are in question. Thus scientists are being forced to ask whether
                              all biological evolution is a response to variation and natural selection
                              or whether, at the molecular level, it may depend instead on an
                              accumulation of variations which result in "genetic drift" without the
                              operation of Darwinian natural selection. Says Dr. Motoo Kimura of the
                              National Institute of Genetics in Japan, evolution at the molecular level
                              appears to be "quite incompatible with the expectations of neo-
                              Darwmism."

                              Other long held assumptions are being shaken as well. Biologists have
                              told us that eukaryotes (human beings and most other forms of life) are
                              ultimately descended from simpler cells called prokaryotes (among
                              which are bacteria and algae) . Fresh research is now undermining
                              that theory, leading to the unsettling notion that the simpler life forms
                              may have descended from the more complex.]]></page><page Index="238"><![CDATA[Furthermore, evolution is supposed to favor adaptations that enhance

                              fact.

                              One day in 1953 at Cambridge in England a young biolo-/•i-.i, James
                              Watson, was sitting in the Eagle pub when his col-lengtie, Francis
                              Crick, ran excitedly in and announced to "< vcryone within hearing
                              distance that we had found the '.< net of life." They had. Watson and
                              Crick had unraveled the structure of DNA.

                              Arthur Kornberg learned how DNA repro-.lurcs itself. Since then, as
                              one popular summary describes • In- sequence, "We have cracked the
                              DNA code . . . We Imvc learned how DNA transmits its instructions to

                              294 THE THIRD WAVE

                              THE PROGRESS TREE

                              With Second Wave ideas about nature and evolution both changing, it
                              is hardly surprising that we are also sharply re-evaluating Second
                              Wave ideas about progress. The industrial period was characterized,
                              as we saw earlier, by a facile optimism that saw each scientific
                              breakthrough or "new improved product" as evidence of an inevitable
                              advance toward human perfection. Since the mid-1950's, when the
                              Third Wave began battering Second Wave civilization, few ideas have
                              taken as rough a beating as this cheery creed.

                              The "beats" of the fifties and the hippies of the sixties made pessimism
                              about the human condition, not optimism, a pervasive cultural theme.
                              These movements did much to replace knee-jerk optimism with knee-
                              jerk despair.

                              Soon pessimism became positively chic. Hollywood movies of the
                              1950's and 1960's, for example, replaced the jut-jawed i heroes of the
                              1930's and 1940's with alienated antiheroes— rebels without a cause,
                              stylish gunmen, dope pushers with eharm, angst-ridden motorcyclists,
                              and hard, inarticulate (but soulful) punks. Life was a game nobody
                              won.

                              Fiction, drama, and art also took on a graveyard hopelessness in many
                              Second Wave nations. By the early fifties, Camus had already defined
                              the themes that countless novelists would subsequently pursue. A
                              British critic summed these up as: "Man is fallible, political theories are
                              relative, auto-, matic progress is a mirage." Even science fiction, once
                              filled with Utopian adventures, turned bitter and pessimistic, gener-1
                              ating countless poor imitations of Huxley and Orwell.

                              Technology, instead of being portrayed as the engine of progress,
                              increasingly appeared as a juggernaut destroying\ both human
                              freedom and the physical environment. For! many environmentalists,
                              indeed, "progress" became a dirty \ word. Weighty volumes poured into
                              the bookshops, bearing] titles like The Stalled Society, The Coming
                              Dark Age, /rtl Danger of Progress, or The Death of Progress.

                              As Second Wave society lurched into the seventies, The j Club of

                              industrial world. UpheavalsJ unemployment, and inflation, intensified

                              decide. One thing is clear, however: the notion of inevitable single-
                              track progress, another pillar of indust-real-Ity, found fewer takers as
                              the end of Second Wave civilization loomed closer.

                              Today there is a fast-spreading recognition around the world that
                              progress can no longer be measured in terms of technology or material
                              standard of living alone—that a society that is morally, aesthetically,
                              politically, or environmentally degraded is not an advanced society, no
                              matter how rich or technically sophisticated it may be. In short, we are
                              moving toward a far more comprehensive notion of progress—
                              progress no longer automatically achieved and no longer ill-lined by
                              material criteria alone.

                              We are also less inclined to think of societies as moving itlong one
                              track, each society traveling automatically from one cultural way-
                              station to the next, one more "advanced" limn another. There may be
                              many branch lines, as it were, milier than a single roadbed, and
                              societies may be able to nrliieve comprehensive development in a
                              variety of ways.

                              We are beginning to think of progress as the flowering of a tree with
                              many branches extending into the future, the very vniiety and richness
                              of human cultures serving as a measure. In (his light, today's shift
                              toward a more diverse, de-massified world may itself come to be seen
                              as an important forward Imp—analogous to the tendency toward
                              differentiation and • "inplexity so common in biological evolution.

                              that held Second Wave civ-together.

                              298 THE THIRD WAVE

                              THE FUTURE OF TIME

                              Each emerging civilization brings with it not merely changes in how
                              people handle time in daily life but also changes in their mental maps
                              of time. The Third Wave is redrawing these temporal maps.

                              Second Wave civilization, from Newton on, assumed that time ran
                              along a single line from the mists of the past into the most distant
                              future. It pictured time as absolute, uniform throughout all parts of the
                              universe, and independent of matter and space. It assumed that each
                              moment, or chunk of tune, was the same as the next.

                              Today, according to John Gribbin, an astrophysicist-turned-science-
                              writer, "Sober scientists with impeccable academic credentials and]]></page><page Index="241"><![CDATA[years of research experience calmly inform us that. . . time isn't
                              something that flows inexorably forward at the steady pace indicated
                              by our clocks and calendars, but that it can be warped and distorted in
                              nature, with the end product being different depending on just where
                              you are measuring it from. At the ultimate extreme, supercol-lapsed
                              objects—black holes—can negate time altogether, making it stand still
                              in their vicinity."

                              By the turn of the century Einstein had already proved that time could
                              be compressed and stretched, and had dynamited the notion that time
                              is absolute. He put forth the now classic case of the two observers and
                              the railroad track, which went more or less like this:

                              A man standing alongside a railroad track sees two bolts of lightning
                              strike at the same time—one at the far north end of the track, the other
                              at the south. The observer is mid-Way between the two. A second
                              fellow is sitting in a high-speed train rocketing northward along the
                              track. As he passes the observer outside he, too, sees the bolts of
                              lightning. But to him the two flashes do not appear as simultaneous.
                              Because the train is speeding him away from one and toward the
                              other, the light from one reaches him sooner than the light from the
                              other. To the man on the moving train it appears that the northern flash
                              occurs first.

                              While in daily life the distances are so small and the speed of light so
                              fast that the difference would be unnoticeable, the example dramatized
                              Einstein's point: that the chronological order of events—what comes
                              first, second, or later in time—depends upon the velocity of the
                              observer. Time is not absolute, but relative.

                              This is a long way from the kind of time on which classical physics and
                              indust-reality were based. Both took for granted that "before" or "after"
                              had a fixed meaning hide-pendent of any observer.

                              Today physics is both exploding and imploding. Every day its
                              practitioners hypothesize—or find—new elementary particles or
                              astrophysical phenomena, from quarks to quasars, with amazing
                              implications, some of which are forcing additional changes in our
                              conceptions of time.

                              At one end of the scale, for example, black holes appear to punctuate
                              the skies, sucking into themselves everything, including light itself,
                              straining—if not smashing—the laws of physics. These dark
                              maelstroms, we are told, terminate in "singularities" into which energy
                              and matter simply vanish. Physicist Roger Penrose has even posited
                              the existence of "wormholes" and "white holes" through which the lost
                              energy and matter are spewed into another universe—whatever that
                              might mean.

                              A single moment in the vicinity of a black hole, it is believed, might be
                              the equivalent of eons on earth. Thus if some Interstellar Mission
                              Control were to send a spaceship to explore a black hole, we might]]></page><page Index="242"><![CDATA[have to wait a million years for the ship to arrive. Yet because of
                              gravitational distortion In the vicinity of the black hole, not to mention
                              the effects of velocity, the ship's clock would show the passage of only
                              a few minutes or seconds.

                              When we leave the vast heavens and enter the world of microscopic
                              particles or waves, we find similarly puzzling phenomena. At Columbia
                              University Dr. Gerald Feinberg has oven hypothesized particles called
                              tachyons that move faster ihan light and for which—according to some
                              of his colleagues—time moves backward.

                              The British physicist J. G. Taylor tells us: "The microscopic notion of
                              time is very different from the macroscopic." An-oihcr physicist, Fritjof
                              Capra, puts it more simply. Time, he wiys, is "flowing at different rates
                              in different parts of the universe." Increasingly, therefore, we cannot
                              even speak of "lime" in the singular; there appear to be alternative and
                              plural "times" operating under different rules in different parts of the
                              universe or universes we inhabit. All of which knocks the props from
                              under the Second Wave idea of uni-;l linear time—without substituting
                              ancient notions of cy-< heal time.

                              Ai precisely the same moment, therefore, that we are radi-

                              cally restructuring our social uses of time—by introducing flextime on
                              the job, by decoupling workers from the mechanical conveyor, and in
                              the other ways described in Chapter Nineteen—we are also
                              fundamentally reformulating our theoretical images of time. And while
                              these theoretical discoveries seem at the moment to have no practical
                              application to daily life, the same was true of those seemingly
                              speculative chalk marks on the blackboard—the formulas that led
                              ultimately to the smashing of the atom.

                              SPACE TRAVELERS

                              Many of these changes in our conception of time also blast holes in our
                              theoretical understanding of space, since the two are tightly
                              interwoven. But we are altering our image of space in more immediate
                              ways as well.

                              We are changing the actual spaces in which all of us live, work, and
                              play. How we get to work, how far and how frequently we travel, where
                              we live—all these influence our experience of space. And all these are
                              changing. In fact, as the Third Wave arrives we enter a new phase in
                              humanity's relationship to space.

                              The First Wave, which spread agriculture around the world, brought
                              with it, as we saw earlier, permanent farming settlements in which
                              most people lived out their entire lives within a few miles of their
                              birthplace. Agriculture introduced a stay-put, spatially intensive
                              existence, and fostered intensely local feelings—the village mentality.]]></page><page Index="243"><![CDATA[Second Wave civilization, by contrast, concentrated huge populations
                              in great cities and, because it needed to draw resources from afar and
                              to distribute goods at a distance, it bred mobile people. The culture it
                              produced was spatially extensive and city- or nation- rather than
                              village-centered.

                              The Third Wave alters our spatial experience by dispersing rather than
                              concentrating population. While millions of people continue to pour into
                              urban areas in the still-industrializing parts of the world, all the high-
                              technology countries are already experiencing a reversal of this flow.
                              Tokyo, London, Zurich, Glasgow, and dozens of other major cities are
                              all losing population while middle-sized or smaller cities are showing
                              gains.

                              The American Council of Life Insurance declares: "Some urban experts
                              believe that the major U.S. city is a thing of the past." Fortune
                              magazine reports that "transportation and

                              entitles an article "The Prospect of a Nation With No Important Cities.'*

                              This redistribution of and de-concentration of population will, in due
                              time, alter our assumptions and expectations nhout personal as well as
                              social space, about acceptable commuting distances, about housing
                              density, and many other (liings.

                              In addition to such changes, the Third Wave also appears to be
                              generating a new outlook that is intensely local, yet global—even
                              galactic. Everywhere we find a new concentration on "community" and
                              "neighborhood," on local politics nnd local ties at the same time that
                              large numbers of people—often the same ones who are most locally
                              oriented—concern themselves with global issues and worry about
                              famine or war 10,000 miles away.

                              As advanced communications proliferate and we begin to shift work
                              back into the electronic cottage, we will encourage this new dual focus,
                              breeding large numbers of people who remain reasonably close to
                              home, who migrate less often, who travel more perhaps for pleasure
                              but far less often for business—while their minds and messages range
                              across the entire planet and into outer space as well. The Third Wave
                              mentality combines concern for near and far.

                              We are also rapidly adopting more dynamic and relativistic Images of
                              space. I have in my office several large blowups of satellite and U-2
                              photographs of New York City and the surrounding area. The satellite

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              When this happens the map will no longer be a static representation
                              but a movie—indeed an X ray in motion, since it will show not merely
                              what is on the surface of the earth but also reveal, layer by layer, what
                              lies below the surface and above it at each level of altitude. It will
                              provide a sensitive, continually changing image of terrain and our
                              relationships to it.

                              Some map makers, meanwhile, are rebelling against the conventional
                              world map seen in every Second Wave classroom. Since the industrial
                              revolution the most commonly used map of the world has been based
                              on Mercator's projection. While this type of map is convenient for
                              ocean navigation, it wildly distorts the scale of land surfaces. A quick
                              look at your handy atlas will—if it uses a Mercator map— show
                              Scandinavia as larger than India, even though the latter is actually
                              almost three times larger.

                              Hot controversy rages among map makers over a new projection
                              developed by Arno Peters, a German historian, to show land surfaces
                              in proper proportion to one another. Peters charges that the distortions
                              of the Mercator map have fostered the arrogance of the industrial
                              nations and made it difficult for us to see the non-industrialized world in
                              proper political, as well as cartographic, perspective.

                              "Developing countries have been cheated with regard to their surface
                              and their importance," Peters contends. His map, strange to the
                              European or American eye, shows a shrunken Europe, a flattened and
                              squashed Alaska, Canada, and Soviet Union, and a much elongated
                              South America, Africa, Arabia, and India. Sixty thousand copies of the
                              Peters map have been distributed in the non-industrial countries by the
                              Weltmission, a German evangelical mission and other religious
                              organizations.

                              What this controversy underscores is the recognition that there is no
                              single "right" map, but merely different images of space that serve
                              different purposes. In the most literal sense the arrival of the Third
                              Wave brings a new way of looking at the world.

                              emphasizes contexts, relationships, and wholes.

                              In the early fifties, at almost precisely the same time that biologists
                              were breaking the genetic code, communications theorists and
                              engineers at the Bell Labs, computer specialists ni IBM, physicists at
                              Britain's Post Office Laboratory, and specialists at Le Centre National
                              de Recherche Scientifique in I-ranee, also began a period of intense
                              and exciting work.

                              Drawing on "operations research" conducted during World War II, but
                              advancing far beyond it, this work gave birth to the automation
                              revolution and a whole new phylum or species of technology that
                              underpins Third Wave production In factory and office. Along with the
                              hardware, however, i-.ime a new way of thinking. For a key product of
                              the automation revolution was the "systems approach."

                              Whereas Cartesian thinkers emphasized the analysis of components,
                              often at the expense of context, systems thinkers stressed what Simon
                              Ramo, an early advocate of systems theory, called a "total, rather than
                              a fragmentary, look flt problems." Emphasizing the feedback
                              relationships among •ubsystems and the larger wholes formed by
                              these units, systems thinking has had a pervasive cultural impact since
                              the nml-1950's when it first began to seep out of the laboratories. Its
                              language and concepts have been employed by social HI i entists and
                              psychologists, by philosophers and foreign policy analysts, by logicians
                              and linguists, by engineers and administrators.

                              But the advocates of systems theory are not the only ones In the past
                              decade or two who have urged a more integrative wny of looking at
                              problems.

                              The revolt against narrow overspecialization also received a IK>ost
                              from the environmental campaigns of the 1970's, as « »logists
                              increasingly discovered the "web" of nature, the in-i(nclatedness of
                              species, and the wholeness of ecosystems. "Non-environmentalists
                              tend to want to separate things into • "inponents and to solve one thine
                              at a time," wrote Barry I »|H-7 in Environmental Action. By contrast,

                              information in most universities, this demand for inter- or multi-
                              disciplinary work is now so widespread it has an almost ritual quality.

                              These changes in intellectual life were mirrored elsewhere in the
                              culture as well. Eastern religions, for example, had long had a tiny
                              fringe following among the European middle classes, but it was not
                              until the disintegration of industrial society began in earnest that
                              thousands of Western young people began lionizing Indian swamis,
                              jamming the Astrodome to hear a 16-year-old guru, listening to ragas,
                              opening Hindu-style vegetarian restaurants, and dancing down Fifth
                              Avenue. The world, they suddenly chanted, was not broken into
                              Cartesian chips: it was a "oneness."

                              In the field of mental health, psychotherapists searched for ways to
                              cure the "whole person" by employing gestalt therapy. A gestalt
                              explosion erupted that saw the establishment of gestalt therapists and
                              institutes throughout the United States. The goal of mis activity,
                              according to psychotherapist Frederick S. Perls, was "to increase
                              human potential through the process of integration" of the individual's
                              sensory awareness, perceptions, and relationships with the outside
                              world.

                              In medicine, a "holistic health" movement has sprung up based on the
                              notion that the well-being of the individual depends on an integration of
                              the physical, the spiritual, and the mental. Mixing quackery with serious
                              medical innovation, the movement gained enormous strength in the
                              late 1970's.

                              "A few years ago," reports Science, "it would have been unthinkable for
                              the federal government to lend its sponsorship to a conference on
                              health that featured such topics as faith healing, iridology,
                              acupressure, Buddhist meditation, and electromedicine." Since then
                              there has been "a virtual explosion of interest in alternative healing
                              methods and systems, all of which go under the name of holistic
                              health."

                              With so much activity, on so many different levels, it is hardly
                              surprising that the terms "wholism" or "holism" should have crept into
                              the popular vocabulary. Today they are used almost indiscriminately. A
                              World Bank expert calls for "a holistic understanding of ... urban
                              shelter." A research group in the United States Congress demands
                              long-range "holistic" studies. A curriculum expert claims to employ
                              "holistic reading and scoring" in teaching school children to write. And
                              a Beverly Hills beauty gym offers "holistic exercise."

                              Each of these movements, fads, and cultural currents is different. But
                              their common element is clear. All of them represent an attack on the
                              assumption that the whole can be understood by studying the parts in
                              isolation. Then* thrust is summed up in the words of philosopher Ervin
                              Laszlo, a leading systems theorist: we are "part of an interconnected

                              lead us to our own destruction."

                              This attack on the fragmentary, on the partial and analytic has grown
                              so fierce, in fact, that many fanatic "holists" blithely forget the parts in
                              their pursuit of the ineffable whole. The result is not wholism at all but
                              yet another fragmentation. Their wholism is halfism.

                              More thoughtful critics, however, seek to balance Second Wave
                              analytic skills with a much greater emphasis on synthesis. This idea
                              was perhaps most clearly expressed by ecolo-gist Eugene P. Odum in
                              urging his colleagues to combine wholism with reductionism—to look
                              at whole systems as well ns their parts. "As components ... are
                              combined to produce larger functional wholes," he declared when he
                              and his more famous brother, Howard, jointly won the Prix de 1'Institut
                              de In Vie, "new properties emerge that were not present or not evident
                              at the next level below....

                              "This is not to say that we abandon reductionist science, since a great
                              deal of good has resulted for mankind from this approach," but that the
                              time has come to give equal backing to studies of "large-scale
                              integrated systems."

                              Taken together, systems theory, ecology, and the generalized
                              emphasis on wholistic thinking—like our changing conceptions of time
                              and space—are part of the cultural at-Ifick on the intellectual premises
                              of Second Wave civilization. That attack reaches its culmination,
                              however, in the emerging new view of why things happen as they do:
                              the new causality.

                              Second Wave civilization gave us the comfortable assurance Mint we
                              knew (or at least could know) what caused things to Imppcn. It told us
                              that every phenomenon occupied a unique, <l> iiTminable location in
                              space and time. It told us that the NIIme conditions always produced
                              the same results. It told us

                              billiard balls—causes and effects.

                              This mechanistic view of causality was—and still is—extremely useful.
                              It helps us cure disease, build giant skyscrapers, design ingenious
                              machines, and assemble huge organizations. Yet, powerful as it is in
                              explaining phenomena that work like simple machines, it has proved
                              far less satisfactory in explaining phenomena like growth, decay,
                              sudden breakthroughs to new levels of complexity, big changes that
                              suddenly fizzle out or, conversely, those tiny—often chance— events

                              world are piecing together a new view of chance and causation more in
                              keeping with our rapidly changing views of nature, evolution, and
                              progress, of time, space, and matter.

                              The Japanese-born epistemologist Magoroh Maruyama, the French
                              sociologist Edgar Morin, information theorists like Stafford Beer and
                              Henri Laborit, and many others are providing clues to how causation
                              works in nonmechanical systems that live, die, grow, and undergo both
                              evolution and revolution. The Belgian Nobel Prize-winner, Ilya
                              Prigogine, offers us a staggering synthesis of the ideas of order and
                              chaos, chance and necessity, and how these relate to causation.

                              In part, the emerging Third Wave causality arises from a key concept
                              of systems theory: the idea of feedback. A classical example used to
                              illustrate this notion is the home thermostat that maintains room
                              temperature at an even level. The thermostat turns on the furnace,
                              then monitors the resulting temperature rise. When the room is warm
                              enough, it turns the furnace off. When the temperature falls, it senses
                              this change in its environment and flicks the furnace on again.

                              What we see here is a feedback process that preserves equilibrium,
                              damping down or suppressing change when it threatens to exceed a
                              given level. Called "negative feedback," its function is to maintain
                              stability.

                              Once negative feedback was defined and explored by information
                              theorists and systems thinkers in the late 1940's and early 1950's,
                              scientists began looking for examples or analogues of it. And with
                              rising excitement, they found similar stability-protecting systems in
                              every field from physiology (for example, the processes by which the
                              body maintains its

                              dissent when it goes beyond an acceptable level). Negative feedback
                              seemed to be at work all around us, reusing things to retain their
                              equilibrium or stability.

                              By the early 1960's, however, critics like Professor M.iruyama began to
                              note that too much attention was being paid to stability and not enough
                              to change. What was needed, he argued, was more research on
                              "positive feedback"— processes that do not suppress change but
                              amplify it, do not maintain stability but challenge it, sometimes even
                              overwhelming it. Positive feedback, Maruyania emphasized, can lake a
                              small deviation or "kick" in the system and magnify it into a giant
                              structure-threatening shudder.

                              If the first kind of feedback was change-reducing or "nega-live," here
                              was a whole class of processes that were change-nmplifying or
                              "positive," and both needed equal attention. Positive feedback could
                              illuminate causation in many previously puzzling processes.]]></page><page Index="249"><![CDATA[Because positive feedback breaks stability and feeds on it-Nclf, it helps

                              the room got warm, the thermostat, instead of shutting off the furnace,
                              would click it on, forcing the temperature to hotter and hotter levels. Or

                              economics) in which the more money a pl.iycr has, the more property
                              he or she can buy, which means more rental income and therefore

                              plexity in the world with which we are dealing. Our understanding of
                              causation is advanced.

                              Yet another leap in understanding occurs when we further recognize
                              that these change reducers and amplifiers are not necessarily built into
                              biological or social systems from the beginning; they may be absent at
                              first, then grow into place, as it were, sometimes as a result of what
                              amounts to chance. A stray event can thus trigger a fantastic chain of
                              unexpected consequences.

                              This tells us why change is so often hard to track and extrapolate, so
                              filled with surprise. It is why a slow, steady process can suddenly
                              convert into an explosive change, or vice versa. And this in turn
                              explains why similar starting conditions may lead to sharply dissimilar
                              outcomes—an idea alien to the Second Wave mentality.

                              The Third Wave causality that is gradually taking shape pictures a
                              complex world of mutually interacting forces, a world filled with
                              astonishment, with change amplifiers as well as reducers and many

                              THE TERMITE LESSON

                              Dr. Ilya Prigogine and his teams of co-workers at the Free University of
                              Brussels and the University of Texas at Austin have struck directly at
                              Second Wave assumptions by showing how chemical and other
                              structures leap to higher stages of differentiation and complexity
                              through a combination of chance and necessity. It is for this work that
                              Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize.

                              Hunted since youth by the problems of time, Prigogine was

                              I -I i/,/.led by a seeming contradiction. On the one hand, there uM , the
                              physicist's belief in entropy—that the universe is run-liiiij', down and
                              that all organized patterns must eventually de-• .\v. On the other, there
                              was the biologist's recognition that hir itself is organization and that we
                              are continually giving i lie to higher and higher, more and more
                              complex organization. Entropy pointed in one direction, evolution in
                              another.

                              This led Prigogine to ask how higher forms of organization mine into
                              being, and to years of research hi chemistry and physics in pursuit of
                              the answer.

                              Today Prigogine points out that in any complex system,

                              quivering with fluctuation.

                              Sometimes, when negative feedback comes into play, these
                              fluctuations are damped out or suppressed and the equilib-nuin of the
                              system maintained. But, where amplifying or positive feedback is at

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              He suggests that evolution itself may be seen as a process leading
                              toward increasingly complex and diversified biological and social
                              organisms, through the emergence of new, higher-order dissipative
                              structures. Thus, according to Prigogine, whose ideas have political
                              and philosophical resonance as well as purely scientific meaning, we
                              develop "order out of fluctuation" or, as the title of one of his lectures
                              expresses it, "Order out of Chaos."

                              This evolution, however, cannot be planned or predetermined in a
                              mechanistic fashion. Until quantum theory came along, many leading
                              Second Wave thinkers believed that chance played little or no role in
                              change. The starting conditions of a process predetermined its
                              outcome. Today in subatomic physics, for example, it is widely
                              believed that chance dominates change. In recent years many
                              scientists, like Jacques Monod in biology, Walter Buckley in sociology,
                              or Maruyama in epistemology and cybernetics, have begun to fuse
                              these opposites.

                              Prigogine's work not only combines chance and necessity but actually
                              stipulates their relationship to one another. In brief, he strongly
                              suggests that at the precise point at which a structure "leaps" to a new
                              stage of complexity, it is impossible, in practice and even in principle,
                              to predict which of many forms it will take.* But once a pathway has
                              been chosen, once the new structure comes into being, determinism
                              dominates once more.

                              In one colorful example he describes how termites create their highly
                              structured nests out of apparently unstructured activity. They begin by
                              crawling about a surface in random fashion, stopping here and there to
                              deposit a bit of "goo.** These deposits are distributed by chance, but
                              the substance contains a chemical attractant so that other termites are
                              drawn to it.]]></page><page Index="252"><![CDATA[In this way, the goo begins to collect in a few places, gradually building
                              up into a pillar or wall. If these buildups are isolated, work stops. But if
                              by chance they are near one another, an arch results that then
                              becomes the basis for the complex architecture of the nest. What
                              begins with random activity turns into highly elaborate nonrandom
                              structures. We see, as Prigogine puts it, "the spontaneous formation of
                              coherent structures." Order out of chaos.

                              * This presumably goes for the leap from Second Wave to Third Wave
                              civilization as well as for chemical reactions.

                              THE MENTAL MAELSTROM

                              309

                              All this strikes hard at the old causality. Prigogine sums it up: "The laws
                              of strict causality appear to us today as limit-ing situations, applicable
                              to highly idealized cases, nearly as caricatures of the description of
                              change . . . The science of complexity... leads to a completely different
                              view."

                              Instead of being locked into a closed universe that func-tioned like a
                              mechanical clock, we find ourselves in a far more flexible system in
                              which, as he says, "there is always the possibility of some instability
                              leading to some new mecha-nism. We really have an- 'open universe.'
                              "

                              As we move beyond Second Wave causal thinking, as we begin to
                              think in terms of mutual influence, of amplifiers and reducers of system
                              breaks and sudden revolutionary leaps, of dissipative structures and
                              the fusion of chance and neces-sitty -in short, as we take off our
                              Second Wave blinders—we merge blinking into a wholly new culture,
                              the culture of the Third Wave.

                              This new culture—oriented to change and growing diver-sity—attempts
                              to integrate the new view of nature, of evolution and progress, the new,
                              richer conceptions of time and space, and the fusion of reductionism
                              and wholism, with a new causality.

                              Indust-reality, which once seemed so powerful and com-plete, so all-
                              encompassing an explanation of how the universe and its components
                              fitted together, turns out now to have herein immensely useful. But its
                              claims to universality are shattered. The super-ideology of the Second
                              Wave will be seen, from the vantage point of tomorrow, to have been
                              as provincial as it was self-serving.

                              The decay of the Second Wave thought system leaves millions of
                              people grasping desperately for something to hold on to-- anything,
                              from Texas Taoism to Swedish Sufism, from Philippine faith healing to
                              Welsh witchcraft. Instead of consuming a new culture appropriate to
                              the new world, they at-temp to import and implant old ideas
                              appropriate to other times and places or to revive the fanatic faiths of
                              their own ancestors who lived under radically different conditions.

                              310 THE THIRD WAVE

                              In the very midst of this spiritual supermarket, with its depressing
                              razzmatazz and religious fakery, a positive new culture is being
                              seeded—one appropriate to our time and place. Powerful new
                              integrative insights are beginning to emerge, new metaphors for
                              understanding reality. It is possible to glimpse the earliest beginnings
                              of a new coherence and elegance as the cultural debris of industrialism
                              is swept away by history's Third Wave of change.

                              The super-ideology of Second Wave civilization that is now crumbling
                              was reflected in the way industrialism organized the world. An image of
                              nature based on discrete particles was mirrored in the idea of discrete,
                              sovereign nation-states. Today, as our image of nature and matter
                              change, the nation-state itself is being transformed—another step on
                              the path toward a Third Wave civilization.

                              THE CRACK-UP OF THE

                              NATION

                              At a time when the flames of nationalism burn fiercely n round the
                              world—when national liberation movements proliferate in places like
                              Ethiopia and the Philippines, when tiny islands like Dominica in the
                              Caribbean or Fiji in the South Pacific declare then* nationhood and
                              send delegates to the United Nations—a strange thing is happening in
                              the high-technology world: instead of new nations arising, old ones are
                              in danger of coming apart.

                              As the Third Wave thunders across the earth, the nation-utate—the
                              key political unit of the Second Wave era—is IK-ing squeezed by
                              viselike pressures from above and below.

                              One set of forces seeks to transfer political power downward from the
                              nation-state to subnational regions and groups. The others seek to
                              shift power upward from the nation to tiansnational agencies and
                              organizations. Together they are leading toward a crack-up of the high-
                              technology nations into Ninaller and less powerful units, as a look
                              around the world quickly reveals.

                              economy, Corsicans were angered anew when units of the French
                              Foreign Legion were shipped to bases hi Corsica after the Algerian
                              war. The locals were further outraged when the government gave the
                              pieds noirs—ex-colonials from Algeria—subsidies and special rights to
                              settle in Corsica. Settlers arrived hi hordes and promptly bought up
                              many of the island's vineyards (the main industry, apart from tourism),
                              leaving the Corsicans to feel even more like strangers on their own
                              island. Today France has a small-scale Northern Ireland brewing on its
                              Mediterranean island.

                              At the opposite end of the country, too, long-simmering separatist
                              sentiments have flared up hi recent years. In Brittany, with high
                              unemployment and some of the lowest wage scales hi France, the
                              separatist movement has widespread popular support. It is split into
                              rival parties and has a terrorist arm whose members have been
                              arrested for bombing public buildings including the palace at Versailles.
                              Meanwhile Paris is beset with demands for cultural and regional
                              autonomy in Alsace and Lorraine, parts of the Languedoc, and other
                              sections of the country.

                              Across the Channel, Britain confronts comparable, though less violent,
                              pressures from the Scots. In the early 1970's, talk about Scottish
                              nationalism was regarded as a joke in London. Today, with North Sea
                              oil providing the potential for Scotland's independent economic
                              development, the issue is not funny at all. While a move to create a
                              separate Scottish assembly was defeated in 1979, pressures for
                              autonomy run deep. Long irked by government policies that favored
                              the economic development of the South, Scottish nationalists now
                              charge that then- own economy is poised for a takeoff, and that the
                              sluggish British economy is dragging them down.

                              They demand more control over their oil. They also seek to supplant
                              their depressed steel and shipbuilding industries with new ones based
                              on electronics and other advanced industries. Indeed, while Britain is"

                              Elsewhere hi Britain separatist pressures are evident in Wales, and
                              tiny autonomist movements are even surfacing in Cornwall and
                              Wessex, where local regionalists demand home rule, their own
                              legislative assembly, and a transition out of backward industry into high
                              technology.

                              From Belgium (where tension among the Walloons, ihe Flemish and
                              the Bruxelloises is rising) to Switzerland (where a split-away group
                              recently won a fight for their own canton in the Jura) to West Germany
                              (where Sudeten Germans are demanding the right to return to their
                              original homeland in nearby Czechoslovakia) to the South Tyrolese in
                              Italy, the Slovenes in Austria, the Basques and Catalans in Spain, the
                              Croatians in Yugoslavia, and dozens of lesser known groups, all of
                              Europe is feeling a relentless buildup of centrifugal pressures.

                              On the other side of the Atlantic, Canada's internal crisis over Quebec
                              is not yet over. The election of the Quebecois separatist premier, Rene
                              Levesque, the flight of capital and business from Montreal, the
                              heightened bitterness between French-speaking and English-speaking
                              Canadians have created the real possibility of national disintegration.
                              Former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, fighting to preserve national
                              unity, warned that "if certain centrifugal tendencies fulfill them-selves,
                              we will have permitted this country either to break up or to become so
                              divided that its existence and its ability to act as one nation will have
                              been destroyed." Quebec, moreover, is not the only source of divisive
                              pressures. Perhaps equally important, though less well known abroad,
                              is the swelling chorus of separatist or autonomist voices in oil-rich
                              Alberta. Across the Pacific, nations like Australia and New Zealand
                              display similar tendencies. In Perth a mining magnate named Hancock
                              has charged that mineral-rich Western Aus-tralia is compelled to pay
                              artificially high prices for eastern Australia's manufactured wares.
                              Among other things, Western Australia claims that it is politically
                              underrepresented in Can berra; that, in a country of vast distances,
                              airfares are rigged against her; and that national policies discourage
                              foreign in vestment in the West. The gold-lettered sign outside Lang
                              Hancock's office reads "Western Australia Secession Move ment."

                              Meanwhile New Zealand has its own troubles with break-aways. The
                              South Island's hydroelectric power provides much

                              shortages of the mid-1970's and declared: "Let the Bastards Freeze in
                              the Dark." The thinly veiled implication of secession could also be
                              found in the wording of an ad placed in The New York Times by the
                              state of Louisiana. It urged the reader to "Consider an America without
                              Louisiana."

                              Midwesterners today are being advised to stop "chasing smoke-
                              stacks," to move to more advanced industry, and to start thinking like
                              regionalists, while Northeastern governors are organizing themselves]]></page><page Index="256"><![CDATA[to defend that region's interests. The public mood was hinted at in a
                              full-page ad placed by a Coalition to Save New York. The ad charged
                              that "New York Is Being Raped" by federal policies and that "New
                              Yorkers can fight back."

                              What does all this belligerent talk around the world, not to mention the
                              protests and violence, add up to? The answer is unmistakable:
                              potentially explosive internal stresses within the nations spawned by
                              the industrial revolution.

                              Some of these stresses obviously arise from the energy crisis and the
                              need to shift from a Second Wave to a Third Wave energy base.
                              Others can be traced to conflicts over the transition from a Second
                              Wave to a Third Wave industrial base. In many places we are also
                              witnessing, as suggested in Chapter Nineteen, the growth of
                              subnational or regional economies that are as large, complex, and
                              internally differentiated as national economies were a generation ago.
                              These form the economic launching pad for separatist movements or
                              drives for autonomy.

                              But whether taking the form of open secessionism, of regionalism,
                              bilingualism, home-rulism, or decentralism, these centrifugal forces
                              also gain support because national governments are unable to
                              respond flexibly to the rapid de-massifi-cation of society.

                              As the mass society of the industrial era disintegrates under the impact
                              of the Third Wave, regional, local, ethnic, social, and religious groups
                              grow less uniform. Conditions and needs diverge. Individuals, too,
                              discover or reassert their differences.

                              Corporations typically meet this problem by introducing more variety
                              into their product lines and by a policy of aggressive "market
                              segmentation."

                              National governments, by contrast, find it difficult to custo-

                              mize their policies. Locked into Second Wave political and bureaucratic
                              structures, they find it impossible to treat each region or city, each
                              contending racial, religious, social, sexual, or ethnic group differently,
                              let alone to treat each citizen as an individual. As conditions diversify,
                              national decision-makers remain ignorant of fast-changing local
                              requirements. If they try to identify these highly localized or specialized
                              needs, they wind up deluged with overdetailed, indigestible data.

                              Pierre Trudeau, caught in the struggle against Canadian se-
                              cessionism, put it clearly as early as 1967 when he argued: "You can't
                              have an operative, operating system of federal government if one part
                              of it, province or state, is in a very important special status, if it has a
                              different set of relationships toward the central government than the
                              other provinces."]]></page><page Index="257"><![CDATA[In consequence, national governments in Washington, London, Paris,
                              or Moscow continue, by and large, to impose uniform, standardized
                              policies designed for a mass society on increasingly divergent and
                              segmented publics. Local and individual needs are forgotten or
                              ignored, causing the flames of resentment to reach white heat As de-
                              massification progresses, we can expect separatist or centrifugal
                              forces to intensify dramatically and threaten the unity of many nation-
                              states.

                              The Third Wave places enormous pressures on the nation-state from
                              below.

                              FROM THE TOP DOWN

                              At the same time, we see equally powerful fingers clawing at the
                              nation-state from above. The Third Wave brings new problems, a new
                              structure of communications, and new actors on the world stage—all of
                              which drastically shrink the power of the individual nation-state.

                              Just as many problems are too small or localized for national
                              governments to handle effectively, new ones are fast arising that are
                              too large for any nation to cope with alone. "The nation state, which
                              regards itself as absolutely sovereign, is obviously too small to play a
                              real role at the global level," writes the French political thinker, Denis
                              de Rouge-n icnt. "No one of our 28 European states can any longer by
                              iisclf assure its military defense and its prosperity, its technological

                              ecological catastrophes." Nor can the United States, the Soviet Union,
                              or Japan.

                              Tightened economic linkages between nations make it virtually
                              impossible for any individual national government today to manage its
                              own economy independently or to quarantine inflation. The ever-
                              swelling bubble of Euromoney, for example, as suggested earlier, is
                              beyond the power of any individual nation to regulate. National
                              politicians who claim their domestic policies can "halt inflation" or "wipe
                              out unemployment" are either naive or lying, since most economic
                              infections are now communicable across national boundaries. The
                              economic shell of the nation-state is now increasingly permeable.

                              Furthermore, national borders that can no longer contain economic
                              flows are even less defensible against environmental forces. If Swiss
                              chemical plants dump wastes into the Rhine, the pollution flows
                              through Germany, through Holland, and ultimately into the North Sea.
                              Neither Holland nor Germany can, by itself, guarantee the quality of its
                              own waterways. Oil tanker spills, air pollution, inadvertent weather
                              modification, the destruction of forests, and other activities often
                              involve side effects that sweep across national borders. Frontiers are
                              now porous.]]></page><page Index="258"><![CDATA[The new global communications system further opens each nation to
                              penetration from the outside. Canadians have long resented the fact
                              that some 70 U.S. television stations along the border telecast,
                              programs to Canadian audiences. But this Second Wave form of
                              cultural penetration is minor compared with that made possible by
                              Third Wave communications systems based on satellites, computers,
                              teleprinters, interactive cable systems, and dirt cheap ground stations.

                              "One way to 'attack' a nation," writes United States Senator George S.
                              McGovern, "is to restrain the flow of information—cutting off contact
                              between the headquarters and overseas branches of a multinational
                              firm . . . building information walls around a nation. ... A new phrase is
                              entering the international lexicon—'infonnation sovereignty.'"

                              Yet it is questionable how effectively national borders can be sealed
                              off—or for how long. For the shift toward a Third Wave industrial base
                              requires the development of a highly ramified, sensitive, wide open
                              "neural network" or information system, and attempts by individual

                              breakthrough provides yet another way to penetrate the nation's outer
                              shell.

                              All such developments—the new economic problems, the new
                              environmental problems, and the new communications technologies—
                              are, converging to undermine the position of the nation-state in the
                              global scheme of things. What's more, they come together at precisely
                              the moment when potent new actors appear on the world scene to
                              challenge national power.

                              The best-publicized and most powerful of these new forces is the
                              transnational or, more commonly, the multinational corporation.

                              What we have seen in the past 25 years is an extraordinary
                              globalization of production, based not merely on the export of raw
                              materials or finished manufactured goods from one country to another,
                              but on the organization of production across national lines.

                              The transnational corporation (or TNC) may do research in one
                              country, manufacture components in another, assemble them in a
                              third, sell the manufactured goods in a fourth, deposit its surplus funds
                              in a fifth, and so on. It may have op-crating affiliates in dozens of
                              countries. The size, importance, and political power of this new player
                              in the global game has skyrocketed since the mid-1950's. Today at
                              least 10,000 companies based in the non-communist high-technology
                              nations have affiliates outside their own countries. Over 2,000 have
                              alliMates in six or more host countries.

                              Of 382 major industrial firms with sales over $1 billion, fully 242 had 25
                              percent or more "foreign content" measured in terms of sales, assets,
                              exports, earnings, or employment. And while economists disagree

                              in the world system—and a challenge to the nation-state.

                              To glimpse their scale, it helps to know that on a given day In 1971
                              they held $268 billion hi short-term liquid assets. 'I'Iiis, according to the

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              By the early 1970's, General Motors' annual s ales revenue was larger
                              than the Gross National Product of Belgium or Switzerland. Such
                              comparisons led economist Lester Brown, president of the Worldwatch
                              Institute, to note ^hat "It was once said that the sun never set on the
                              British Ennpire. Today the sun does set on the British Empire, but not
                              on the scores of global corporate empires including those of IB31,
                              Unilever, Volkswagen and Hitachi."

                              Exxon alone has a tanker fleet 50 percent larger than that of the Soviet
                              Union. The East-West specialist Josef Wilczynski, an economist at the
                              Royal Military College of Australia, once whimsically pointed out that in
                              1973 "The proceeds from the sales" of only ten of these transnational
                              corporations would have been "enough to give the 58,000,000
                              members of the Communist Parties in all the 14 Socialist countries a
                              six-month holiday at the American standard of

                              living."

                              While typically thought of as a capitalist invention, the fact is that some
                              50 "socialist transnationals" operate through the COMECON countries,
                              laying pipelines, making chemicals and ball bearings, extracting potash
                              and asbestos, and running ship lines. Moreover, socialist banks and
                              financial institutions—ranging from the Moscow Narodny Bank to the
                              Black Sea and Baltic General Insurance Company—do business in
                              Zurich, Vienna, London, Frankfurt, or Paris. Some Marxist theorists
                              now regard the "internationalization of production" as necessary and
                              "progressive." In addition, of the 500 Western-based, privately owned
                              TNCs whose sales in 1973 exceeded $500 million, fully 140 had
                              "significant commercial dealings" with one or more of the COMECON

                              countries.

                              Nor are the TNCs only based in the rich nations. The 25 countries in
                              the Lathi American Economic System recently moved to create
                              transnationals of their own in the fields of agri-business, low-cost
                              housing, and capital goods. Philippine-based companies are
                              developing deepwater ports in the Persian Gulf, and Indian
                              transnationals are building electronics plants hi Yugoslavia, steel mills
                              in Libya, and a machine tool industry in Algeria. The rise of the TNC
                              alters the position of the nation-state on the planet.]]></page><page Index="260"><![CDATA[Marxists tend to see national governments as handmaidens of
                              corporate power, and therefore stress the commonality of interests
                              between the two, yet the TNCs very often have then*

                              THE CRACK-UP OF THE NATION 321

                              own interests that run counter to those of their "home" nations, and
                              vice versa.

                              "British" TNCs have violated British embargos. "American" TNCs have
                              violated U.S. regulations concerning the Arab boycott of Jewish firms.
                              During the OPEC embargo the transnational oil companies rationed
                              deliveries between countries according to their own, not national,
                              priorities. National loyalties fade quickly when opportunities present
                              themselves elsewhere, so that TNCs transfer jobs from country to
                              country, escape environmental rules, and play off host countries
                              against one another.

                              "For the past few centuries," Lester Brown has written, "the world has
                              been neatly divided into a set of independent, sovereign nation-states.
                              . . . With the emergence of literally hundreds of multinational or global
                              corporations, this organization of the world into mutually exclusive
                              political entities is now being overlaid by a network of economic
                              institutions."

                              In this matrix, the power that once belonged exclusively to the nation-
                              state when it was the only major force operating on the world scene is,
                              at least in relative terms, sharply reduced.

                              Indeed, transnationals have already grown so large that they have
                              taken on some of the features of the nation-state itself—including then*
                              own corps of quasi-diplomats and their own highly effective intelligence
                              agencies.

                              "The multinationals' intelligence needs . . . are not much different from
                              those of the United States, France or any other country. . . . Indeed,
                              any discussion of the intelligence battles among the CIA, KGB, and
                              their satellite agencies will be incomplete if it doesn't describe the
                              increasingly important roles played by the apparats of Exxon, Chase
                              Manhattan, Mitsubishi, Lockheed, Phillips and others," writes Jim
                              Hougan in Spooks, an analysis of the private intelligence agencies.

                              Sometimes cooperating with their "home" nation, sometimes exploiting
                              it, sometimes executing its policies, sometimes using it to execute their
                              own, the TNCs are neither all good nor all bad. But with their ability to
                              shunt billions back and forth instantly across national boundaries, their
                              power to deploy technology and to move relatively quickly, they have
                              often outflanked and outrun national governments.

                              "It is not just, or even mainly, a question of whether international
                              companies can circumvent particular regional laws and regulations,"
                              writes Hugh Stephenson in a study of the

                              thought and reaction is found in the . . . concept of the sovereign nation
                              state [while] international corporations are rendering this notion
                              invalid."

                              In terms of the global power system, the rise of the great transnationals
                              has reduced, rather than strengthened, the role of the nation-state at
                              precisely the time when centrifugal pressures from below threaten to
                              part it at the seams.

                              THE EMERGING "T-NET"

                              Though they are the best known, the transnational corporations are not
                              the only forces on the global stage. We are witnessing, for example,
                              the rise of transnational trade union groupings—the mirror image, as it
                              were, of the corporations. We are also seeing a growth of religious,
                              cultural, and ethnic movements that flow across national lines and link
                              up with one another. We observe an antinuclear movement whose
                              demonstrations in Europe draw protesters together from several
                              countries at a time. We also are witnessing the emergence of
                              transnational political party groupings. Thus Christian Democrats and
                              Socialists alike speak of forming themselves into "Europarties" that
                              transcend individual national boundaries—a move accelerated by the
                              creation of the European Parliament.

                              Paralleling these developments, meanwhile, is a rapid proliferation of
                              nongovernmental transnational associations. Such groups devote
                              themselves to everything from education to ocean exploration, sports
                              to science, horticulture to disaster relief. They range from the Oceania
                              Football Confederation to the International Red Cross, the International
                              Federation of Small and Medium-Sized Commercial Enterprises, and
                              the International Federation of Women Lawyers. In aggregate, such
                              "umbrella" organizations or federations represent millions of members
                              and tens of thousands of branches in many countries. They reflect
                              every conceivable shade of political interest or lack of interest

                              In 1963 some 1,300 such organizations operated across national lines.
                              By the mid-1970's the number had doubled to 2,-600. The total is
                              expected to zoom to 3,500—4,500 by 1985 —with a new one springing
                              up approximately every three days.

                              If the United Nations is the "world organization," these

                              less visible groups form, in effect, a "second world organization." Their
                              aggregate budgets in 1975 amounted to a mere $1.5 billion—but this is
                              only a tiny fraction of the resources controlled by their subordinate
                              units. They have their own "trade association"—the Brussels-based
                              Union of International Associations. They relate to one another
                              vertically, with local, regional, national, and other groupings coming
                              together under the transnational organization. They also relate]]></page><page Index="262"><![CDATA[horizontally through a dense mesh of consortia, working groups,
                              interorganizational committees, and task forces.

                              So dense are these transnational ties that, according to a study by the
                              Union of International Associations, there were an estimated 52,075
                              identifiable, interlocking relationships and cross-linkages among 1,857
                              such groups in 1977. And this number is soaring upward, too. Literally
                              thousands of transnational meetings, conferences, and symposia bring
                              the members of these different groupings into contact with one
                              another.

                              Though still relatively underdeveloped, this fast-growing transnational
                              network (or T-Net) adds yet another dimension to the emerging Third
                              Wave world system. Even this does not complete the picture, however.

                              The nation-state's role is still further diminished as nations themselves
                              are forced to create supranational agencies. Nation-states fight to
                              retain as much sovereignty and freedom of action as they can. But
                              they are being driven, step by step, to accept new constraints on their
                              independence.

                              European countries, for example, grudgingly but inevitably have been
                              driven to create a Common Market, a European parliament, a
                              European monetary system, and specialized agencies like CERN—the
                              European Organization for Nuclear Research. Richard Burke, the
                              Common Market's tax commissioner, brings pressure to bear on
                              member nations to alter their domestic tax policies. Agricultural and
                              industrial policies once determined in London or Paris are hammered
                              out in Brussels. Members of the European Parliament actually ram
                              through an $840-million increase in the EEC budget over the
                              objections of their national governments.

                              The Common Market is perhaps the prime example of the gravitation
                              of power to a supranational agency. But it is not the only example. We
                              are, in fact, seeing a population explosion of such inter-governmental
                              organizations (or IGOs) —groupings or consortia of three or more
                              nations. They range from the World Meteorological Organization and

                              324

                              the International Atomic Energy Agency to the International Coffee
                              Organization or the Latin American Free Trade Association, not to
                              mention OPEC. Today such agencies are needed to coordinate global
                              transport, communications, patents, and work in dozens of other fields
                              from rice to rubber. And the number of such IGOs has also doubled,
                              shooting up from 139 in 1960 to 262 in 1977.

                              Through these IGOs, the nation-state seeks to cope with larger than
                              national problems, while retaining maximum de-cisional control at the
                              national level. Bit by bit, however, a steady gravitational shift occurs as
                              more decisions are transferred to—or constrained by—these larger
                              than national organizational entities.

                              From the rise of the transnational corporation to the population
                              explosion of transnational associations to the creation of all these
                              IGOs, we see a set of developments all moving in the same direction.]]></page><page Index="263"><![CDATA[Nations are less and less able to take independent action—they are
                              losing much of their sovereignty.

                              What we are creating is a new multilayered global game in which not
                              merely nations but corporations and trade unions, political, ethnic, and
                              cultural groupings, transnational associations and supranational
                              agencies are all players. The nation-state, already threatened by
                              pressures from below, finds its freedom of action constrained, its
                              power displaced or diminished, as a radically new global system takes
                              form.

                              PLANETARY CONSCIOUSNESS

                              The shrinkage of the nation-state reflects the appearance of a new-
                              style global economy that has emerged since the Third Wave began its
                              surge. Nation-states were the necessary political containers for nation-
                              sized economies. Today the containers have not only sprung leaks,
                              they have been made obsolete by their own success. First, there is the
                              growth within them of regional economies that have attained a scale
                              once associated with national economies. Second, the world economy
                              to which they gave rise has exploded in size and is taking on strange
                              new forms.

                              Thus the new global economy is dominated by the great transnational
                              corporations. It is serviced by a ramified banking and financial industry
                              that operates at electronic speeds. It breeds money and credit no
                              nation can regulate. It moves toward transnational currencies—not a

                              money" but a variety of currencies or "meta-currencies," each based
                              on a "market basket" of national currencies or commodities. It is torn
                              by a world-scale conflict between resource suppliers and users. It is
                              riddled with shaky debt on a hitherto unimaginable scale. It is a mixed
                              economy, with private capitalist and state-socialist enterprises forming
                              joint ventures and working side by side. And its ideology is not laissez
                              faire or Marxism, but globalism—the idea that nationalism is obsolete.

                              Just as the Second Wave created a slice of the population that had
                              larger than local interests and became the base for nationalist
                              ideologies, so the Third Wave gives rise to groups with larger than
                              national interests. These form the base of the emerging globalist
                              ideology sometimes called "planetary consciousness."

                              This consciousness is shared by multinational executives, long-haired
                              environmental campaigners, financiers, revolutionaries, intellectuals,
                              poets, and painters, not to mention members of the Trilateral
                              Commission. I have even had a famous U.S. four-star general assure
                              me that "the nation-state is dead." Globalism presents itself as more
                              than an ideology serving the interests of a limited group. Precisely as
                              nationalism claimed to speak for the whole nation, globalism claims to
                              speak for the whole world. And its appearance is seen as an]]></page><page Index="264"><![CDATA[evolutionary necessity—a step closer to a "cosmic consciousness" that

                              In sum, therefore, at every level, from economics and politics to
                              organization and ideology, we are witnessing a devastating attack,
                              from within and without, on that pillar of Second Wave civilization: the
                              nation-state.

                              At the exact historical moment when many poor countries are
                              desperately fighting to establish a national identity because nationhood
                              hi the past was necessary for successful industrialization, the rich
                              countries, racing beyond industrialism, are diminishing, displacing, or
                              derogating the role of the nation.

                              We can expect the next decades to be torn by struggle over the
                              creation of new global institutions capable of fairly representing the
                              prenational as well as the postnational peoples of the world.

                              326 THE THIRD WAVE

                              MYTHS AND INVENTIONS

                              No one today, from the experts in the White House or the Kremlin to
                              the proverbial man in the street, can be sure how the new world
                              system will shake out—what new kinds of institutions will arise to
                              provide regional or global order. But it is possible to dispel several
                              popular myths.

                              The first of these is the myth propagated by such films as Rollerball
                              and Network, in which a steely-eyed villain announces that the world
                              is, or will be, divided up and run by a group of transnational
                              corporations. In its most common form this myth pictures a single
                              worldwide Energy Corporation, a single Food Corporation, a single
                              Housing Corporation, a single Recreation Corporation, and so forth. In
                              a variant, each of these is seen as a department of an even larger
                              mega-corporation.

                              This simplistic image is based on straight-line extrapolations from
                              Second Wave trends: specialization, maximization, and centralization.

                              Not only does this view fail to take into account the fantastic diversity of
                              of real life conditions, the^ clash of cultures, religions, and traditions in
                              the world, the speed of change, and the historic thrust now carrying the
                              high-technology nations toward de-massification; not only does it
                              naively presuppose that such needs as energy, housing, or food can
                              be neatly compartmentalized; it ignores the fundamental changes now
                              revolutionizing the structure and purpose of the corporation itself. It is
                              based, in short, on an obsolete, Second Wave image of what a
                              corporation is and how it is structured.

                              The other, closely related fantasy pictures a planet run by a single,
                              centralized World Government. This is usually imagined as an
                              extension of some existing institution or government—a "United States
                              of the World," a "Planetary Proletarian State," or simply the United
                              Nations writ large. Again the thinking is based on simplistic extensions
                              of Second Wave principles.]]></page><page Index="265"><![CDATA[What appears to be emerging is neither a corporation-dominated future
                              nor a global government but a far more complex system similar to the
                              matrix organizations we saw springing up hi certain advanced
                              industries. Rather than one or a few pyramidal global bureaucracies,
                              we are weaving nets or matrices that mesh different kinds of
                              organizations with common interests.

                              We may, for example, see the emergence over the next dec-

                              ade of an Oceans Matrix, composed not solely of nation-states but of
                              regions, cities, corporations, environmental organizations, scientific
                              groups, and others with an interest in the sea. As changes occur new
                              groupings would emerge and plug into the matrix, while others would
                              drop out. Similar organizational structures may well emerge—are, in
                              some sense, already emerging—to deal with other issues: a Space
                              Matrix, a Food Matrix, a Transport Matrix, an Energy Matrix, and the
                              like, all flowing into and out of one another, overlapping and forming a
                              messily open, rather than a neatly closed, system.

                              In short, we are moving toward a world system composed of units
                              densely interrelated like the neurons in a brain rather than organized
                              like the departments of a bureaucracy.

                              As this happens, we can expect a tremendous struggle to break out
                              within the United Nations over whether that organization shall remain a
                              "trade association of nation-states" or whether other types of units—
                              regions, perhaps religions, even corporations or ethnic groups—should
                              be represented in

                              it.

                              As nations are torn apart and restructured, as JTNCs and other new
                              factors move onto the global scene, as instabilities and the threats of
                              war erupt, we shall be called upon to invent wholly new political forms
                              or "containers" to bring a semblance of order to the world—a world in
                              which the nation-state has become, for many purposes, a dangerous
                              anachronism.

                              The headline writers search frantically for terms to describe what they
                              perceive as mounting world disorder. The Islamic uprising hi Iran stuns
                              them. The sudden reversal of Maoist policies in China, the collapse of
                              the dollar, the new militancy of the poor countries, outbreaks of
                              rebellion in El Salvador or Afghanistan are all seen as startling,
                              random, unconnected events. The world, we are told, is careening
                              toward chaos.

                              We will look back on today as the twilight of Second Wave civilization,
                              and be saddened by what we see. For as it came to a close, industrial
                              civilization left behind a world hi which one quarter of the species lived
                              in relative affluence, three quarters in relative poverty—and
                              800,000,000 hi what the World Bank terms "absolute" poverty. Fully
                              700,000,000 people were underfed and 550,000,000 illiterate. An
                              estimated 1,200,000,000 human beings remained without access to
                              public health facilities or even safe, drinkable water, as the industrial
                              age ended.

                              It left behind a world hi which some 20 to 30 industrialized nations
                              depended on the hidden subsidies of cheap energy and cheap raw
                              materials for much of then* economic success. It left a global

                              powers. It left many of the poor countries with one-crop economies
                              twisted to serve the needs of the rich.

                              The rapid emergence of the Third Wave not only foreshadows the end
                              of the Second Wave imperium, it also explodes all our conventional
                              ideas about ending poverty on the planet.

                              THE SECOND WAVE STRATEGY

                              Ever since the late 1940's a single dominant strategy has governed
                              most efforts to reduce the gap between the world's rich and poor. I call
                              this the Second Wave strategy.

                              This approach starts with the premise that Second Wave societies are
                              the apex of evolutionary progress and that, to solve their problems, all
                              societies must replay the industrial revolution essentially as it
                              happened in the West, the Soviet Union, or Japan. Progress consists
                              of moving millions of people out of agriculture into mass production. It
                              requires urbanization, standardization, and all the rest of the Second
                              Wave package. Development, in brief, involves the faithful imitation of
                              an already successful model.

                              Scores of governments in country after country have, in fact, tried to
                              carry out this game plan. A few, like South Korea or Taiwan, where
                              special conditions prevail, appear to be succeeding in establishing a
                              Second Wave society. But most such efforts have met with disaster.

                              These failures in one impoverished country after another have been
                              blamed on a mind-bending multiplicity of reasons. Neo-colonialism.
                              Bad planning. Corruption. Backward religions. Tribalism. Transnational
                              corporations. The CIA. Going too slowly. Going too fast. Yet, whatever
                              the reasons, the grim fact remains that industrialization according to
                              the Second Wave model has flopped far more frequently than it has
                              succeeded.]]></page><page Index="267"><![CDATA[Iran offers only the most dramatic case in point.

                              As late as 1975 a tyrannical Shah boasted he would make Iran into the
                              most advanced industrial state in the Middle East by pursuing the
                              Second Wave strategy. "The Shah's builders," reported Newsweek,
                              "toiled over a glorious array of mills, dams, railroads, highways and all
                              the other trimmings

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              of a full-fledged industrial revolution." In June 1978 international
                              bankers were still scrambling to lend billions at hair-thin interest rates
                              to the Persian Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, to the Mazadern Textile
                              Company, to Tavanir, the state-owned power utility, to the steel
                              complex at Isfahan and the Iran Aluminium Company, among others.

                              While this buildup was supposedly turning Iran into a "modern" nation,
                              however, corruption ruled Teheran. Conspicuous consumption
                              aggravated the contrast between rich and poor. Foreign interests—
                              mainly, but not exclusively, American—had a field day. (A German
                              manager in Teheran was paid a third more than he could have earned
                              at home, but his employees worked for one tenth a German worker's
                              pay-packet.) The urban middle class existed as a tiny island within a
                              sea of misery. Apart from oil, fully two thirds of all the goods produced
                              for the market were consumed in Teheran by one tenth the country's
                              population. In the countryside, where income was barely a fifth of that
                              in the city, the rural masses continued to live under revolting and
                              repressive conditions.

                              Nurtured by the West, attempting to apply the Second Wave strategy,
                              the millionaires, generals, and hired technocrats who ran the Teheran
                              government conceived of development as a basically economic
                              process. Religion, culture, family life, sexual roles—all these would
                              take care of themselves if only the dollar signs were got right. Cultural
                              authenticity meant little because, steeped in indust-reality, they saw
                              the world as increasingly standardized rather than moving toward
                              diversity. Resistance to Western ideas was simply dismissed as
                              "backward" by a cabinet 90 percent of whose members had been
                              educated at Harvard, Berkeley, or European universities.

                              Despite certain unique circumstances—like the combustive mixture of
                              oil and Islam—much of what happened in Iran was common to other
                              countries pursuing the Second Wave strategy. With some variation,
                              much the same might be said of dozens of other poverty-stricken
                              societies from Asia and Africa to Latin America.

                              The collapse of the Shah's regime in Teheran has sparked a
                              widespread debate in other capitals from Manila to Mexico City. One
                              frequently asked question has to do with the pace of change. Was the
                              pace too accelerated? Did the Iranians suffer from future shock? Even
                              with oil revenues, can governments create a large enough middle class

                              compel us to question the very root premises of the Second Wave
                              strategy.

                              Is classical industrialization the only path to progress? And does it
                              make any sense to imitate the industrial model at a time when
                              industrial civilization itself is caught in its terminal agonies?

                              THE BROKEN SUCCESS MODEL

                              So long as the Second Wave nations remained "successful"—stable,
                              rich, and getting richer—it was easy to look upon them as a model for
                              the rest of the world. By the late 1960's, however, the general crisis of
                              industrialism had exploded.

                              Strikes, blackouts, breakdowns, crime, and psychological distress
                              spread throughout the Second Wave world. Magazines did cover
                              pieces on "why nothing works any more." Energy and family systems
                              shook. Value systems and urban structures crumbled. Pollution,
                              corruption, inflation, alienation, loneliness, racism, bureaucratism,
                              divorce, mindless consumerism, all came under savage attack.
                              Economists warned of the possibility of a total collapse of the financial
                              system.

                              A global environmental movement, meanwhile, warned that pollution,
                              energy, and resource limits might soon make it impossible for even the
                              existing Second Wave nations to continue normal operations. Beyond
                              this, it was pointed out, even if the Second Wave strategy did,
                              miraculously, work in the poor nations, it would turn the entire planet
                              into a single giant factory and wreak ecological havoc.

                              Gloom descended on the richest nations as the general crisis of
                              industrialism deepened. And suddenly millions around the world asked
                              themselves not merely if the Second Wave strategy could work but
                              why anyone would want to emulate a civilization that was itself in the
                              throes of such violent disintegration.

                              Another startling development also underminded the belief that the
                              Second Wave strategy was the only path from rags to riches. Always
                              implicit in this strategy was the assumption that "first you 'develop,'
                              then you grow rich"—that affluence

                              was the result of hard work, thrift, the Protestant Ethic, and a long
                              process of economic and social transformation.

                              However, the OPEC embargo and the sudden flood of pet-ro-dollars
                              into the Middle East stood this Calvinist notion on its pointed head.]]></page><page Index="269"><![CDATA[Within mere months unexpected billions spewed, splashed, and
                              spumed into Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Libya, and other Arab

                              rather than following, transformation. In the Middle East, it was the
                              money that produced the drive to "develop," rather than "development"
                              that produced the money. Nothing like that, on so vast a scale, had
                              ever happened before.

                              Meanwhile, competition among the rich nations themselves was
                              heating up. "With South Korean steel being used at California

                              emerging dramatically as a major potential industrial force, concern is
                              mounting over how far developing economies will undercut established
                              industries in the advanced nations of Japan, the United States and
                              Europe," wrote a Tokyo correspondent for The New York Times.

                              Striking French steelworkers, as one might expect, put it more
                              colorfully. They called for an end to "the massacre of industry" and
                              protesters occupied the Eiffel Tower. In one after another of the older
                              industrial nations, Second Wave industries and their political allies
                              attacked the "export of jobs" and policies that spread industrialization
                              to the poorer countries.

                              In short, doubts mushroomed on all sides as to whether the much-
                              trumpeted Second Wave strategy could—or even should work.

                              THE FIRST WAVE STRATEGY

                              Faced by the failures of the Second Wave strategy, rocked by angry
                              demands by the poor countries for a total overhaul of the global
                              economy, and deeply worried about their own future—the rich nations
                              hi the 1970's began to hammer out a new strategy for the poor.

                              Almost overnight many governments and "development agencies,"
                              including the World Bank, the Agency for Interna-

                              tional Development, and the Overseas Development Council, switched
                              to what can only be called a First Wave strategy.

                              This formula is almost a carbon copy reverse of the Second Wave
                              strategy: Instead of squeezing the peasants and forcing them into the
                              overburdened cities, it calls for a new emphasis on rural development.
                              Instead of concentrating on cash crops for export, it urges food self-
                              sufficiency. Instead of striving blindly for higher GNP in the hopes that
                              benefits will trickle down to the poor, it calls for resources to be
                              channeled directly into "basic human needs."

                              Instead of pushing for labor-saving technologies, the new approach
                              stresses labor-intensive production with low capital, energy, and skill
                              requirements. Instead of building giant steel mills or large-scale urban]]></page><page Index="270"><![CDATA[factories, it favors decentralized, small-scale facilities designed for the
                              village.

                              Turning Second Wave arguments upside down, the advocates of the
                              First Wave strategy were able to show that many industrial
                              technologies were a disaster when transferred to a poor country.
                              Machines broke down and went unrepaired. They needed high-cost,
                              often imported raw materials. Trained labor was in short supply.
                              Hence, the new argument ran, what was needed were "appropriate
                              technologies." Sometimes called "intermediate," "soft," or "alternative,"
                              these would lie, as it were, "between the sickle and the combine
                              harvester."

                              Centers for the development of such technologies soon sprang up all
                              over the United States and Europe—the Intermediate Technology
                              Development Group founded in 1965 in Britain serving as an early
                              model. But the developing countries, too, created such centers and
                              began pouring out low-scale technological innovations.

                              The Mochudi Farmers Brigade in Botswana, for example, has
                              developed an ox- or donkey-drawn device that can be used for
                              plowing, planting, and spreading fertilizer in single or double row
                              cultivation. The Department of Agriculture in Gambia has adopted a
                              Senegalese tool-frame which can be used with a single moldboard
                              plow, a groundnut lifter, a seeder, and a ridger. In Ghana work is going
                              forward on a pedal-driven rice thresher, a screw press for spent
                              brewer's grain, and an all-wood squeezer to extract water from banana
                              fiber.

                              The First Wave strategy has been applied on a much broader basis as
                              well. Thus hi 1978 the new government of India, still reeling from oil
                              and fertilizer price hikes and from disappointment with the Second

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              Nehru and Indira Gandhi, actually banned further expansion of its
                              mechanized textile industry and urged increased production of fabrics
                              on handlooms instead of power looms. The intent was not merely to
                              increase employment but to retard urbanization by favoring rural
                              cottage industry.

                              There is much about this new formula that admittedly makes excellent
                              sense. It confronts the need to slow down the massive migration to the
                              cities. It aims to make the villages—where the bulk of the world's poor
                              dwell—more livable. It is sensitive to ecological factors. It stresses the
                              use of cheap local resources rather than expensive imports. It
                              challenges conventional, all-too-narrow definitions of "efficiency." It
                              suggests a less technocratic approach to development, taking local
                              custom and culture into account. It emphasizes improving the
                              conditions of the poor rather than passing capital through the hands of
                              the rich in the hopes that some will trickle down.]]></page><page Index="271"><![CDATA[Yet after all due credit is given, the First Wave formula remains just
                              that—a strategy for ameliorating the worst of First Wave conditions
                              without ever transforming them. It is a Band-Aid, not a cure, and it is
                              perceived in exactly these terms by many governments around the
                              world.

                              Indonesian President Suharto expressed a widely held view when he
                              charged that such a strategy "may be the new form of imperialism. If
                              the West contributes only to small-scale grassroots projects, our plight
                              may be alleviated somewhat but we will never grow."

                              The sudden love affair with labor-intensivity is also subject to the
                              charge that it is self-serving for the rich. The longer the poor countries
                              remain under First Wave conditions, the fewer competitive goods they
                              are likely to shove onto an overloaded world market. The longer they
                              stay down on the farm, so to speak, the less oil, gas, and other scarce
                              resources they will siphon off, and the weaker and less troublesome
                              they will remain politically.

                              There is also, built deep into the First Wave stragegy, a paternalistic
                              assumption that while other factors of production need to be
                              economized, the time and energy of the laborer needn't be—that
                              unrelieved backbreaking toil in the fields or rice paddies is fine—so
                              long as it is done by somebody else.

                              Samir Amin, director of the Institute of African Economic Development
                              and Planning, sums up, many of these views, saying that labor-
                              intensive techniques have suddenly been

                              rendered attractive, "thanks to a medley of hippie ideology, return to
                              the myth of the golden age and the noble savage, and criticism of the
                              reality of the capitalist world."

                              Worse yet, the First Wave formula dangerously de-emphasizes the
                              role of advanced science and technology. Many of the technologies
                              now being promoted as "appropriate" are even more primitive than
                              those available to the American farmer of 1776—closer by far to the
                              sickle than to the harvester. When American and European farmers
                              began to employ more "appropriate technology" 150 years ago, when
                              they shifted from wooden to steel harrow teeth or to the iron plow, they
                              did not turn their back on the world's accumulated knowledge of
                              engineering and metallurgy—they seized it.

                              At the Paris Exposition of 1855, according to a contemporary account,
                              newly-invented threshing machines were dramatically demonstrated.
                              "Six men were set to threshing with flails at the same moment that the
                              different machines commenced operations, and the following were the
                              results of an hour's work:

                              Only those who have never spent years at grueling manual labor can
                              lightly brush aside machinery that, as early as 1855, could thresh grain
                              123 times faster than a man.

                              Much of what we now call "advanced science" was developed by
                              scientists in rich countries to solve the problems of the rich countries.
                              Precious little research has been addressed to the everyday problems
                              of the world's poor. Nonetheless, any "development policy" that begins
                              by blinding itself to the potentials of advanced scientific and
                              technological knowledge condemns hundreds of millions of desperate,
                              hungry, toiling peasants to perpetual degradation.

                              In some places, and at certain times, the First Wave strategy can
                              improve life for large numbers of people. Yet there is painfully little
                              evidence to show that any sizable country can ever produce enough,
                              using premechanized First Wave methods, to invest in change. Indeed,
                              a mass of evidence suggests the exact opposite.

                              By dint of heroic effort, Mao's China—which invented and

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              tried out basic elements of the First Wave formula—almost, but not
                              quite, managed to prevent famine. This was a towering achievement.
                              But by the late sixties, the Maoist emphasis on rural development and
                              backyard industry had gone as far as it could go. China had reached a
                              dead end.

                              For the First Wave formula, by itself, is ultimately a recipe for
                              stagnation and is no more applicable to the entire range of poor
                              countries than the Second Wave strategy.

                              In a world of exploding diversity we shall have to invent scores of
                              innovative strategies and stop looking for models either in the industrial
                              present—or in the preindustrial past. It is time we began to look at the
                              emergent future.

                              THE THIRD WAVE QUESTION

                              Must we remain forever trapped between two obsolete visions? I have
                              deliberately caricatured these alternative strategies to sharpen the
                              differences. In real life, few governments can afford to follow abstract
                              theories, and we find many attempts to combine elements of both
                              strategies. Yet the rise of the Third Wave strongly suggests that we no
                              longer need to Ping-Pong back and forth between these two formulas.]]></page><page Index="273"><![CDATA[For the arrival of the Third Wave drastically alters everything. And
                              while no theory emanating from the high-technology world, whether
                              capitalist or Marxist in bias, is going to solve the problems of the
                              "developing world," and no existing models are wholly transferable, a
                              strange new relationship is springing up between First Wave societies
                              and the fast-forming Third Wave civilization.

                              More than once we have seen naive attempts to "develop" a basically
                              First Wave country by imposing on it highly incongruous Second Wave
                              forms—mass production, mass media, factory-style education.
                              Westminster-style parliamentary government, and the nation-state, to
                              name a few—without recognizing that for these to operate
                              successfully, traditional family and marriage customs, religion, and role
                              structures would all have to be crushed, the entire culture ripped up by
                              its roots.

                              By astonishing contrast, Third Wave civilization turns out to have many
                              features—decentralized production, appropriate scale, renewable
                              energy, de-urbanization, work in the home, high levels of presumption,
                              to name just a few—that actually

                              resemble those found in First Wave societies. We are seeing
                              something that looks remarkably like a dialectical return.

                              This is why so many of today's most startling innovations arrive with a
                              comet's tail of trace memories. It is this eerie sense of deja vu which
                              accounts for the fascination with the rural past that we find in the most
                              rapidly emergent Third Wave societies. What is so striking today is that
                              First and Third Wave civilizations seem likely to have more in common
                              with each other than with Second Wave civilization. They are, in short,
                              congruous.

                              Will this strange congruity make it possible for many of today's First
                              Wave countries to take on some of the features of Third Wave
                              civilization—without swallowing the whole pill, without totally
                              surrendering their culture or first passing through the "stage" of Second
                              Wave development? Will it, in fact, be easier for some countries to
                              introduce Third Wave structures than to industrialize in the classical
                              manner?

                              Is it now possible, moreover, as it was not in the past, for a society to
                              attain a high material standard of living without obsessively focusing all
                              its energies on production for exchange? Given the wider range of
                              options brought by the Third Wave, cannot a people reduce infant
                              mortality and improve life span, literacy, nutrition, and the general
                              quality of life without surrendering its religion or values and necessarily
                              embracing the Western materialism that accompanies the spread of
                              Second Wave civilization?

                              Tomorrow's "development" strategies will come not from Washington
                              or Moscow or Paris or Geneva but from Africa, Asia, and Latin
                              America. They will be indigenous, matched to actual local needs. They]]></page><page Index="274"><![CDATA[will not overemphasize economics txt the expense of ecology, culture,

                              that it may be possible in the decades ahead to combine elements of
                              past and future into a new and better present.

                              Take, for example, the issue of energy.

                              With all the talk about an energy crisis in the countries transitioning into
                              Third Wave civilization, it is often forgotten that First Wave societies
                              are facing an energy crisis of their own. Starting from an extremely low
                              base, what kind of energy systems should they create?

                              Certainly they need big centralized fossil-fuel-based power plants of
                              the Second Wave type. But in many of these societies, as the Indian
                              scientist Amulya Kumar N. Reddy has shown, the most urgent need is
                              for decentralized energy in the countryside rather than vast, centralized
                              supplies for the cities.

                              The family of a landless Indian peasant now spends about six hours a
                              day merely rinding the firewood it needs for cooking and heating.
                              Another four to six hours are spent bringing water from a well, and a
                              similar amount to graze cattle, goats, or sheep. "Since such a family
                              cannot afford to hire labour and cannot buy labour-saving gadgets, its
                              only rational response is to have at least three children to satisfy its
                              energy needs," says Reddy, pointing out that rural energy "may prove
                              an excellent contraceptive."

                              Reddy has studied rural energy needs and concluded that the
                              requirements of a village can easily be met by a tiny, cheap bio-gas
                              plant that uses human and animal waste from the village itself. He has
                              gone on to demonstrate that many thousands of such units would be
                              far more useful, ecologically sound, and economical than a few giant,
                              centralized generating plants.

                              Precisely this reasoning lies behind bio-gas research and installation
                              programs hi countries from Bangladesh to Fiji. India already has
                              12,000 plants hi operation and has targeted for 100,000 units. China

                              solar cells to produce electricity.

                              In Israel molecular biologist Haim Aviv has proposed a joint Egyptian-
                              Israeli agro-industrial project in the Sinai. Using Egyptian water and
                              Israel's advanced irrigation technology, it would be possible to grow
                              cassava or sugar cane, which in turn could be converted into ethanol
                              for use in car fuel. His plan calls for sheep and cattle to be fed on the
                              sugar cane by-products and for paper plants to make use of the
                              cellulose wastes, creating an integrated ecological cycle. Similar
                              projects, Aviv suggests, could be built hi parts of Africa, Southeast
                              Asia, and Latin America.

                              The energy crisis which is part of the breakdown of Second Wave
                              civilization is generating many new ideas for both centralized and
                              decentralized, large-scale and small-scale energy production in the
                              poorer regions of the planet. And there is a clear parallel between
                              some of the problems facing First Wave and emergent Third Wave
                              societies. Neither can rely on energy systems designed for the Second
                              Wave era.

                              What about agriculture? Once again, the Third Wave leads us in
                              unconventional directions. At the Environmental Research Lab in
                              Tucson, Arizona, shrimp are being grown in long troughs in
                              greenhouses, right alongside cucumbers and lettuce—with the shrimp
                              waste recycled to fertilize the vegetables. In Vermont experimenters
                              are raising catfish, trout, and vegetables in a similar manner. The water
                              in the fish tank collects solar heat and releases it at night to keep
                              temperatures up. Again, the fish waste is used to fertilize the
                              vegetables.

                              In Massachusetts, at the New Alchemy Institute chickens are being
                              raised atop the fish tank. Their droppings fertilize algae, which the fish
                              then eat. These are only three of countless examples of innovation in
                              food production and food processing—many of-which have special,
                              exciting relevance for today's First Wave societies.

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              developments are likely to slash, rather than increase, the need for
                              artificial fertilizers. According to the CFR study, chances are nine out of
                              ten that by 1996 we will have cheap controlled-release fertilizer which
                              will reduce the need for nitrogenous fertilizer by 15 percent. There is a
                              substantial likelihood that nitrogen-fixing grains will also be available by
                              then, further reducing demand.

                              The report regards as "virtually certain" new grain varieties which
                              produce higher yields per acre on non-irrigated land—with gains as
                              high as 25 to 50 percent. It suggests that "trickle-drip" irrigation
                              systems, with decentralized wind-powered wells and water distributed
                              by draft animals, could substantially increase yields while cutting year-
                              to-year fluctuations in the harvest.

                              Furthermore, it tells of forage grass that, because it needs only minimal
                              water, could double the livestock carrying capacity of arid regions; of a
                              potential 30 percent jump in non-grain yields in tropical soils as a result
                              of a better understanding of nutrient combinations; of breakthroughs in
                              pest control that will cut crop losses drastically; of new low-cost water
                              pumping methods; of the control of the tsetse fly, which would open up
                              vast new regions to livestock farming; and many other advances.

                              On a longer time-scale, one can imagine much of agriculture devoted
                              to "energy farms"—the cultivation of crops for energy production.
                              Ultimately we may see the convergence of weather modification,
                              computers, satellite monitoring, and genetics to revolutionize the
                              world's food supply.

                              While such possibilities put no food in a hungry peasant's belly today,
                              First Wave governments must consider these potentials in their long-
                              range agricultural planning, and must search for ways to combine, as it
                              were, the hoe and the computer.

                              New technologies, associated with the shift to Third Wave civilization,
                              also open fresh possibilities. The late futurist John McHale and his wife
                              and colleague, Magda Cordell McHale, in their excellent study Basic
                              Human Needs, concluded that the emergence of super-advanced
                              biotechnologies hold great promise for transforming First Wave
                              societies. Such technologies include everything from ocean farming to
                              the use of insects and other organisms for productive work, the
                              processing of cellulose wastes into meat via microorganisms, and the
                              conversion of plants like euphorbia into sul-

                              phur-free fuel. "Green medicine"—the manufacture of Pharmaceuticals
                              from previously unknown or under-utilized plant life—also holds high
                              potential for many First Wave countries.]]></page><page Index="277"><![CDATA[Advances in other fields also cast doubt on traditional development
                              thinking. An explosive issue facing many First Wave countries is
                              massive unemployment and underemployment. This has triggered a
                              global debate between First Wave and Second Wave advocates. One
                              side argues that mass-production industries do not use enough labor,
                              and that the emphasis in development should be placed on smaller-
                              scale, more technologically primitive factories that use more people
                              and less capital and energy. The other side urges the introduction of
                              precisely the Second Wave industries now moving out of the most
                              technologically advanced nations—steel, auto, shoes, textiles, and the
                              like.

                              But rushing off to build a Second Wave steel mill may be (he
                              equivalent of constructing a buggy-whip factory. There may be
                              strategic or other reasons to build a mill but, with wholly new composite
                              materials many times stronger, stiffer, :md lighter than aluminum, with
                              transparent materials that are as strong as steel, with reinforced plastic
                              mortar to replace galvanized water pipes, how long before the demand
                              for steel peaks and production capacity is excessive? According to
                              Indian scientist M. S. lyengar, such advances may "make the linear
                              expansion in steel and aluminium production redundant." Perhaps,
                              instead of seeking loans or foreign investment to build steel capability,
                              the poorer countries ought to be preparing now for the "materials age"?

                              The Third Wave brings more immediate possibilities as well. Ward
                              Morehouse of the Research Policy Program, University of Lund,
                              Sweden, argues that the poor nations should be looking beyond First
                              Wave small-scale industry or Second Wave centralized, large-scale
                              industry, and should focus instead on one of the key industries of the
                              emerging Third Wave: microelectronics.

                              "Over emphasis on labor-intensive technology with low productivity
                              could become a trap for poor countries," More-house writes. Pointing
                              out that productivity is rising spectacularly in the computer chip
                              industry, he argues that "it is certainly an advantage to capital-poor
                              developing countries to get greater output per unit of capital invested."

                              More important, however, is the compatibility between Third Wave
                              technology and existing social arrangements.

                              342

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              Thus, Morehouse says, the great product diversity in microelectronics
                              means that "developing countries can take a basic technology and
                              adapt it more easily to suit their own social requirements or raw
                              materials. Microelectronic technology lends itself to decentralization of
                              production."

                              This also means reduced population pressures on the big cities, and
                              the rapid miniaturization in this field cuts transportation costs as well.
                              Best of all, this form of production has low energy requirements, and
                              the growth of the market is so rapid—and the competition so keen—
                              that even though rich nations attempt to monopolize these industries
                              they are unlikely to succeed.]]></page><page Index="278"><![CDATA[Morehouse is not alone in pointing out how the most advanced Third
                              Wave industries dovetail with the needs of the poor countries. Says
                              Roger Melen, Associate Director of Stanford University's Integrated
                              Circuit Laboratory: "The industrial world moved everybody into the
                              cities for production, and now we're moving the factories and work
                              forces back into the country, but many nations have never really
                              switched from a 17th century agrarian economy, including China. It
                              now appears they can integrate new manufacturing techniques into
                              their society without moving entire populations."

                              If this is so, the Third Wave offers a fresh technological strategy for the
                              war on want.

                              The Third Wave throws the need for transportation and communication
                              into a new perspective as well. At the time of the industrial revolution,
                              roads were a prerequisite for social, political, and economic
                              development. Today an electronic communications system is
                              necessary. It was once thought that communications were the
                              outgrowth of economic development. Now, says John Magee,
                              president of Arthur D. Little, the research firm, this "is an outmoded
                              thesis . . . telecommunications is more of a precondition than a
                              consequence."

                              Today's plummeting cost of communications suggests the substitution
                              of communications for many transport functions. It may be far cheaper,
                              more energy-conserving, and more appropriate in the long run to lay in
                              an advanced communications network than a ramified structure of
                              costly roads and streets. Clearly, road transport is needed. But to the
                              degree that production is decentralized, rather than centralized,
                              transport costs can be minimized without isolating villages

                              from one another, from the urban areas, or from the world at large.

                              That more and more leaders of First Wave countries are aware of the
                              importance of communications is clear from the fight they are waging
                              for a redistribution of the world's electronic spectrum. Because the
                              Second Wave powers developed telecommunications early, they have
                              captured control of the available frequencies. The U.S. and the
                              U.S.S.R. alone use up 25 percent of the available shortwave
                              broadcasting spectrum, and a bigger chunk of the more sophisticated
                              parts of the spectrum.

                              This spectrum, however, like the ocean floor and the planet's
                              breathable air, belongs—or should belong—to everyone, not just a
                              few. Thus many of the First Wave countries insist the spectrum is a
                              limited resource and want to be assigned a share of it—even if at the
                              moment they lack the equipment to use it. (They assume they can
                              "rent out" their part until such time as they are ready to use it
                              themselves.) Facing resistance from both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.,
                              they call for a "New World Information Order."]]></page><page Index="279"><![CDATA[The larger issue they face, however, is internal: how to divide their
                              limited resources between telecommunications and transport. It is the
                              same question that the most technically sophisticated of nations also
                              must confront. Given low-cost ground stations, computerized kibbutz-
                              size irrigation systems, perhaps even ground sensing devices, and
                              super-cheap computer terminals for village use and cottage industry, it
                              may be possible for First Wave societies to avoid some of the
                              enormous expenditure for heavy transport that the Second Wave
                              nations had to bear. Such ideas no doubt sound Utopian today. But the
                              time will soon be on us when they are commonplace.

                              Not long ago, Indonesian President Suharto pressed the tip of a
                              traditional sword against an electronic push button and thereby
                              inaugurated a satellite communications system aimed at linking the
                              parts of the Indonesian archipelago together— much as the railroads
                              with their golden spike linked the two coasts of America a century ago.
                              In so doing, he symbolized the new options that the Third Wave
                              presents to countries seeking transformation.

                              Developments like these in energy, agriculture, technology, and

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              new societies based on the fusion of past and future, of First Wave and
                              Third Wave.

                              One can begin to picture a transformation strategy based on the
                              development of both low-stream, village-oriented, capital-cheap, rural
                              industries and certain carefully selected, high-stream technologies,
                              with an economy zoned to protect or promote both.

                              Jagdish Kapur has written: "A new balance has now to be struck
                              between" the most advanced science and technology available to the
                              human race and "the Gandhian vision of the idyllic green pastures, the
                              village republics." Such a practical combination, Kapur declares,
                              requires a "total transformation of the society, its symbols and values,
                              its system of education, its incentives, the flow of its energy resources,
                              its scientific and industrial research and a whole lot of other
                              institutions."

                              Yet an increasing number of long-range thinkers, social analysts,
                              scholars, and scientists believe that just such a transformation is now
                              under way, carrying us toward a radical new synthesis: Gandhi, in
                              short, with satellites.

                              THE ORIGINAL PROSUMERS

                              Implied in this approach is another synthesis at an even deeper level.
                              This involves the entire economic relationship of people to the
                              market—irrespective of whether that market is capitalist or socialist in
                              form. It forces us to question how much of any individual's total time
                              and labor should be devoted to production and how much to]]></page><page Index="280"><![CDATA[prosumption—i.e., how much to working for pay in the marketplace as
                              against working for self.

                              Most First Wave populations have already been drawn into the money
                              system. They have been "marketized." But while the wretched money
                              income earned by the world's poorest people may be vital to their
                              survival, production for exchange provides only part of their income;
                              prosumption provides the rest.

                              The Third Wave encourages us to look at this situation, too, in a fresh
                              way. In country after country millions are jobless. But is full
                              employment in these societies a realistic goal? What combination of
                              policies can possibly, within our lifetime, provide full-time jobs for all
                              these surging millions? Is the very notion of "unemployment" itself a
                              Second Wave

                              concept, as hinted at by the Swedish economist Gunnar Myr-dal?

                              The problem, writes Paul Streeten of the World Bank, is "not
                              'unemployment,' which is a Western concept that presupposes modern
                              sector wage employment, labor markets, labor exchanges and scoial
                              security payments. . . . The problem [is] rather, unremunerative,
                              unproductive work of the poor, particularly of the rural poor." The
                              remarkable rise of the prosumer in the affluent nations today, a striking
                              phenomenon of the Third Wave, leads us to question the deepest
                              assumptions and goals of most Second Wave economists.

                              Perhaps it is a mistake to emulate the industrial revolution in the West,
                              which saw the transfer of most economic activity out of Sector A (the
                              prosumer sector) and into Sector B (the market sector).

                              Perhaps presumption needs to be seen as a positive force, rather than
                              a regrettable holdover from the past.

                              Perhaps what is needed for most people is part-time employment for
                              wages (possibly with some transfer payments) plus imaginative new
                              policies aimed at making their pro-sumption more "productive." Indeed,
                              linking these two economic activities more intelligently to one another
                              may be the missing key to survival for millions.

                              Practically speaking, this might mean providing "capital tools for
                              presumption"—just as the rich countries now do. In the affluent
                              countries we see a fascinating synergy springing up between the two
                              sectors, with the marketplace providing powerful capital tools for use
                              by the prosumer: everything from washing machines to handdrills to
                              battery testers. Misery in the.poor countries is often so extreme that to
                              speak of washing machines or power tools seems, at first glance,
                              wildly out of place. Yet is there no analogue here for societies moving
                              beyond First Wave civilization?

                              The French architect-planner Yona Friedman reminds us that the
                              world's poor do not necessarily want jobs—they want "food and a roof."]]></page><page Index="281"><![CDATA[The job is only a means to this end. But one can often grow one's own
                              food and build one's own roof, or at least contribute to that process.
                              Thus in a paper for UNESCO, Friedman has argued that governments
                              should encourage what I have called presumption by relaxing certain
                              land laws and building codes. These make it hard (often, indeed,
                              impossible) for squatters to build or improve their own housing.

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              He strongly urges governments to remove these ohstacles and to help
                              people supply their own housing, offering them "assistance in
                              organization, the provision of some materials otherwise difficult to
                              obtain . . . and, if possible, site development"—i.e., water or electricity.
                              What Friedman and others are beginning to say is that anything that
                              helps the individual presume more effectively may be just as important
                              as production measured in conventional GNP terms.

                              To increase the "productivity" of the prosumer, governments need to
                              focus scientific and technological research on presumption. But even
                              now they could, at remarkably low cost, provide simple hand tools,
                              community workshops, trained craftsmen or teachers, limited
                              communications facilities and, where possible, power generation
                              equipment—plus favorable propaganda or moral support for those who
                              invest "sweat equity" hi building their own homes or improving their bits
                              of land.

                              Second Wave propaganda today unfortunately conveys to even the
                              world's most remote and poorest people the idea that the things they
                              make themselves are inherently inferior to the worst mass-produced
                              junk. Rather than teaching people to despise their own efforts, to value
                              Second Wave products and downgrade what they themselves create,
                              governments should be offering prizes for the best or most imaginative
                              self-built homes and goods, the most "productive" presumption. The
                              knowledge that even the world's richest people are increasingly
                              presuming may help change attitudes among the very poorest. For the
                              Third Wave casts into a dramatic new light the entire relationship of
                              market to nonmarket activities in all the societies of the future.

                              The Third Wave also raises non-economic and non-technological
                              concerns to primary importance. It makes us look at education, for
                              example, with fresh eyes. Education, everyone agrees, is central to
                              development. But what kind of education?

                              When the colonial powers introduced formal education into Africa,
                              India, and other parts of the First Wave world, they transplanted either
                              factory-style schools or set up miniature, tenth-rate imitations of their
                              own elite schools. Today Second Wave education models are being
                              questioned everywhere. The Third Wave challenges the Second Wave
                              notion that education necessarily takes place in a classroom. Today
                              we need to combine learning with work, political struggle,

                              about education need to be re-examined both in the rich countries and
                              the poor.

                              Is literacy, for example, an appropriate goal? If so, what does literacy
                              mean? Does it mean both reading and writing? In a provocative paper
                              for the Nevis Institute, a futures research center in Edinburgh, the
                              eminent anthropologist Sir Edmund Leach has argued that reading is
                              easier to learn and more useful than writing, and that not everyone
                              needs to learn to write. Marshall McLuhan has spoken of a return to an
                              oral culture more in keeping with many First Wave com* munities.
                              Speech recognition technology opens incredible new vistas. New,
                              extremely cheap communications "buttons" or tiny tape recorders built
                              into simple agricultural equipment may ultimately be able to give oral
                              instructions to illiterate farmers. In the light of these, even the definition
                              of functional literacy requires fresh thinking.

                              Finally, the Third Wave encourages us to look behind conventional
                              Second Wave assumptions with respect to motivation as well. Better
                              nutrition is likely to raise the entire level of intelligence and functional
                              competence among millions of children—at the same time that it
                              increases drive and motivation.

                              Second Wave people often speak of the passivity and lack of
                              motivation of, say, an Indian villager or a Colombian peasant. Leaving
                              aside the demotivating effects of malnutrition, intestinal parasites,
                              climate, and oppressive political control, might not a part of what
                              seems like lack of motivation be an unwillingness to tear up one's
                              home, family, and life in the present in return for the dubious hope of a
                              better life many years down the road? So long as "development"
                              means the superimposition of a totally alien culture on an existing one,
                              and so long as actual improvements seem impossibly beyond reach,
                              there is every reason to hang on to the little one has.

                              Because many features of Third Wave civilization are consonant with
                              those of First Wave civilization, whether in China or Iran, they imply the
                              possibility of change with less, not more, disruption, pain, and future
                              shock. And they therefore may strike at the roots of what we have
                              called demotiva-tion.

                              And so, not merely in the fields of energy or technology, agriculture or
                              economics, but in the very brain and behavior

                              348 THE THIRD WAVE

                              of the individual, the Third Wave brings the potential for revolutionary
                              change.

                              THE STARTING LINE

                              The emerging Third Wave civilization does not provide a ready-made
                              model for emulation. Third Wave civilization is itself not yet fully
                              formed. But for the poor as well as the rich it opens novel, perhaps
                              liberating, possibilities. For it calls attention not to the weaknesses,
                              poverty, and misery of the First Wave world, but to some of its inherent]]></page><page Index="283"><![CDATA[strengths. The very features of this ancient civilization that seem so
                              backward from the standpoint of the Second Wave appear as
                              potentially advantageous when measured against the template of the
                              advancing Third Wave.

                              The congruity of these two civilizations must, in the years ahead,
                              transform the way we think about the relations between rich and poor
                              on the planet. Samir Amin, the economist, speaks of the "absolute
                              necessity" of breaking out of the "false dilemma: modern techniques
                              copied from the West of today, or old techniques corresponding to
                              conditions in the West a century ago." This is precisely what the Third
                              Wave makes possible.

                              The poor as well as the rich are crouched at the starting line of a new
                              and startlingly different race into the future.


                              CODA: THE GREAT CONFLUENCE

                              We are no longer where we stood a decade ago, dazzled by changes
                              whose relationships to one another were unknown. Today, behind the
                              confusion of change, there is a growing coherence of pattern: the
                              future is taking shape.

                              In a great historical confluence, many raging rivers of change are
                              running together to form an oceanic Third Wave of change that is
                              gaining momentum with every passing hour.

                              This Third Wave of historical change represents not a straight-line
                              extension of industrial society but a radical shift of direction, often a
                              negation, of what went before. It adds up to nothing less than a
                              complete transformation at least as revolutionary in our day as
                              industrial civilization was 300 years ago.

                              Furthermore, what is happening is not just a technological revolution

                              term. Thus, if we briefly look back over the ground we have covered,
                              we find profound and frequently parallel changes at many levels
                              simultaneously.

                              Every civilization operates in and on the biosphere, and reflects or
                              alters the mix of populations and resources. Every civilization has a
                              characteristic techno-sphere—an energy base linked to a production
                              system which in turn is linked to a distribution system. Every civilization
                              has a socio-sphere consisting of interrelated social institutions. Every
                              civilization has an info-sphere—channels of communication through
                              which necessary information flows. Every civilization has its own
                              power-sphere.

                              with the outside world—exploitative, symbioiu. militant or pacific. And
                              every civilization has its own super-ideology—a kit of powerful cultural
                              assumptions that structure its view of reality and justify its operations.

                              The Third Wave, it should now be apparent, is bringing revolutionary
                              and self-reinforcing changes at all these dillci ent levels at once. The
                              consequence is not merely the disintegration of the old society but the
                              creation of foundations for the new.

                              Often, as Second Wave institutions crash about our heads, as crime
                              mounts, as nuclear families fracture, as once reliable bureaucracies
                              sputter and malfunction, as health delivery systems crack and
                              industrial economies wobble dangerously, we see only the decay and
                              breakdown around us. Yet social decay is the compost bed of the new
                              civilization. In energy, technology, family structure, culture, and many
                              other fields, we are laying into place the basic structures that will define
                              the main features of that new civilization.

                              In fact, we can now for the first time identify these main features and
                              even, to some extent, the interrelationships among them.
                              Encouragingly, the embryonic Third Wave civilization we find is not
                              only coherent and workable in both ecological and economic terms,
                              but—if we put our minds to it—could be made more decent and
                              democratic than our own.

                              In no way is this to suggest inevitability. The period of transition will be
                              marked by extreme social disruption, as well as wild economic swings,
                              sectional clashes, secession attempts, technological upsets or
                              disasters, political turbulence, violence, wars, and threats of war. In a
                              climate of disintegrating institutions and values, authoritarian
                              demagogues and movements will arise to seek, and possibly attain,
                              power. No intelligent person can be smug about the outcome. The
                              clash of two civilizations presents titanic dangers.

                              Yet the odds lie not with destruction but with ultimate survival. And it is
                              important to know where the main thrust of change is taking us—what
                              kind of world is likely if we manage to avoid the worst of the short-term
                              perils that lie before us. Briefly then, what kind of society is taking
                              form?

                              Third Wave civilization, unlike its predecessor, must (and will) draw on
                              an amazing variety of energy sources—hydro-pen, solar, geothermal,
                              tidal, biomass, lightning discharges, ul-nmately perhaps advanced
                              fusion power, as well as other mergy sources not yet imagined in the
                              1980's. (While some nuclear plants will no doubt continue to operate,

                              from a civilization based heavily on a single source of energy to one
                              based more securely on many. Ultimately we see a civilization founded
                              once more on Nc-If-sustaining, renewable rather than exhaustible
                              energy lources.

                              Third Wave civilization will rely on a far more diversified technological
                              base as well, springing from biology, genetics, electronics, materials
                              science, as well as on outer space and iinder-the-sea operations.
                              While some new technologies will require high energy inputs, much

                              Nor will Third Wave technologies be as massive and ecologically
                              dangerous as those of the past. Many will be small in scale, simple to
                              operate, with the wastes of one industry predesigned for recycling into
                              primary materials for another.

                              For Third Wave civilization, the most basic raw material of all—and one
                              that can never be exhausted—is information, Including imagination.
                              Through imagination and information, NIinstitutes will be found for
                              many of today's exhaustible resources—although this substitution,
                              once more, will all too frequently be accompanied by drastic economic
                              swings and lurches.

                              With information becoming more important than ever before, the new
                              civilization will restructure education, redefine scientific research and,
                              above all, reorganize the media of communication. Today's mass
                              media, both print and electronic, are wholly inadequate to cope with
                              the communications load and to provide the requisite cultural variety
                              for survival. Instead of being culturally dominated by a few mass

                              personalized imagery into and out of the mind-stream of the society.

                              Looking far ahead, television will give way to "indi-video"—narrow-
                              casting carried to the ultimate: images addressed to a single individual
                              at a time. We may also eventually use drugs, direct brain-to-brain
                              communication, and other forms of electrochemical communication
                              only vaguely hinted at until now. All of which will raise startling, though
                              not insoluble, political and moral problems.

                              The giant centralized computer with its whirring tapes and complex
                              cooling systems—where it still exists—will be supplemented by myriad
                              chips of intelligence, embedded in one form or another in every home,
                              hospital, and hotel, every vehicle and appliance, virtually every
                              building-brick. The electronic environment will literally converse with
                              us.

                              Despite popular misconceptions, this shift toward an information-
                              based, highly electronic society will still further reduce our need for
                              high-cost energy.]]></page><page Index="286"><![CDATA[Nor must this computerization (or, more properly, in-

                              human relationships. As we shall see in the next chapter, people will
                              still hurt, cry, laugh, take pleasure in each other, and play—but they
                              will do all these in a much altered context.

                              The fusion of Third Wave energy forms, technologies, and information
                              media will speed revolutionary changes in the way we work. Factories
                              are still being built (and in some parts of the world they will continue to
                              be built for decades to come), but the Third Wave factory already
                              bears little resemblance to those we have known until now, and—in the
                              rich nations—the number of people in factory jobs will continue to
                              plummet.

                              In Third Wave civilization the factory will no longer serve as a model for
                              other types of institutions. Nor will its primary function be that of mass
                              production. Even now the Third Wave factory produces de-massified—
                              often customized—end products. It relies on advanced methods such
                              as wholistic or "presto" production. It will ultimately use less energy,
                              waste less raw material, employ fewer components, and demand far
                              more design intelligence. Most significantly, many of its machines will
                              be directly activated not by workers but at a distance, by consumers
                              themselves.

                              far less brutalizing or repetitive work than those still trapped in Second
                              Wave jobs. They will not be paced by mechanical conveyor belts.
                              Noise levels will be low. Workers will come and go at hours convenient
                              for them. The actual workplace will be far more humane and
                              individualized, often with flowers and greenery sharing the space with
                              machines. Within fixed limits, payment and fringe benefit packages will
                              be increasingly tailored to individual preference.

                              Third Wave factories will increasingly be found outside the giant urban
                              metropolises. They are also likely to be much smaller than those of the
                              past, with smaller organizational units as well, each enjoying a greater
                              degree of self-management.

                              Similarly, the Third Wave office will no longer resemble the office of
                              today. A key ingredient of office work—paper— will be substantially
                              (though not wholly) replaced. The chattering banks of typewriters will
                              fall silent. The file cabinets will shrink away. The role of the secretary
                              will be transfigured as electronics eliminates many old tasks and opens
                              new opportunities. The sequential movement of papers back and forth
                              across many desks, the endlessly repetitious typing of columns of
                              numbers—all this will become less important and the making of
                              discretionary decisions more important, and more widely shared.

                              To operate these factories and offices of the future, Third Wave
                              companies will need workers capable of discretion and
                              resourcefulness rather than rote responses. To prepare such]]></page><page Index="287"><![CDATA[employees, schools will increasingly shift away from present methods
                              still largely geared to producing Second Wave workers for highly
                              repetitive work.

                              The most striking change in Third Wave civilization, however, will
                              probably be the shift of work from both office and factory back into the
                              home.

                              Not all jobs can, will, or should be carried out in people's homes. But
                              as low-cost communications are substituted for high-cost
                              transportation, as we increase the role of intelligence and imagination
                              in production, further reducing the role of brute force or routine mental
                              labor, a significant slice of the work force in Third Wave societies will
                              perform at least part of its work at home, factories remaining only for
                              those who must actually handle physical materials.

                              This gives us a clue to the institutional structure of Third Wave
                              civilization. Some scholars have suggested that, with I he increasing

                              replace the factory as the central institution of tomorrow. This notion,
                              however, which comes almost exclusively from academics, is based on
                              the provincial assumption that only the university can, or does, house
                              theoretical knowledge. It is little more than a professorial wish-
                              fulfillment fantasy.

                              Multinational executives, for their part, see the executive suite as the
                              pivot of tomorrow. The new profession of "information managers"
                              pictures their computer rooms as the center of the new civilization.
                              Scientists look to the industrial research laboratory. A few remaining
                              hippies dream of restoring the agricultural commune to the center of a
                              neo-medieval future. Others may nominate the "gratification chambers"
                              of a leisure-drenched society.

                              My own nomination, for reasons outlined earlier, is none of these. It is,
                              in fact, the home.

                              I believe the home will assume a startling new importance in Third
                              Wave civilization. The rise of the prosumer, the spread of the electronic
                              cottage, the invention of new organizational structures in business, the
                              automation and de-massifi-cation of production, all point to the home's
                              re-emergence as a central unit in the society of tomorrow—a unit with
                              enhanced rather than diminished economic, medical, educational, and
                              social functions.

                              Yet it is unlikely that any institution—not even the home—will play as
                              central a role as the cathedral or the factory did in the past. For the
                              society is likely to be built around a network rather than a hierarchy of
                              new institutions.

                              This suggests also that the corporations (and the socialist production
                              organizations) of tomorrow will no longer tower over other social]]></page><page Index="288"><![CDATA[institutions. In Third Wave societies, corporations will be recognized as
                              the complex organizations they are, and will pursue multiple goals
                              simultaneously—not just profit or production quotas. Instead of
                              focusing on a single bottom line, as many of today's managers have
                              been trained to do, the shrewd Third Wave manager will watch over
                              (and will be held personally responsible for) multiple "bottom lines."

                              Executive paychecks and bonuses will gradually come to reflect this
                              new multi-functionality, as the corporation, either through voluntary
                              means or because it is compelled to, becomes more responsive to
                              what today are regarded as non-economic and hence largely irrelevant
                              factors—ecological, political, social, cultural, and moral.

                              Second Wave conceptions of efficiency—usually based on

                              CODA: THE GREAT CONFLUENCE

                              355

                              the ability of the corporation to foist its indirect costs off on the
                              consumer or the taxpayer—will be recast to take account of hidden
                              social, economic, and other costs which often, indeed, translate into
                              deferred economic costs as well. "Econo-think"—a characteristic
                              deformation of the Second Wave manager—will be less common.

                              The corporation—like most other organizations—will also undergo
                              drastic restructuring as the ground rules of Third Wave civilization
                              come into play. Instead of a society synchronized to the tempo of the
                              assembly line, a Third Wave society will move to flexible rhythms and
                              schedules. Instead of the mass society's extreme standardization of
                              behavior, ideas, language, and life-styles, Third Wave society will be
                              built on segmentation and diversity. Instead of a society that
                              concentrates population, energy flows, and other features of life, Third
                              Wave society will disperse and de-concentrate. Instead of opting for
                              maximum scale on the "bigger is better" principle, Third Wave society
                              will understand the meaning of "appropriate s«ale." Instead of a highly
                              centralized society, Third Wave society will recognize the value of
                              much decentralized decision-making.

                              Such changes imply a striking shift away from standard old-fashioned
                              bureaucracy, and the emergence in business, government, the
                              schools, and other institutions of a wide variety of new-style
                              organizations. Where hierarchies remain they will tend to be flatter and
                              more transient. Many new organizations will do away with the old
                              insistence on "one man, one boss"—all of which suggests a work world
                              in which more people share temporary decisional power.

                              All the societies moving through the transition to the Third Wave -face
                              deepening short-term unemployment problems. From the 1950's on,
                              vast increases in white-collar and service work absorbed millions of
                              workers laid off by the shrinking manufacturing sector. Today, as
                              white-collar work is in its turn automated, there is serious question as
                              to whether further expansion of the conventional service sector can
                              take up the slack. Some countries mask the problem through feather-
                              bedding, enlarging public and private bureaucracies, exporting excess]]></page><page Index="289"><![CDATA[workers, and the like. But the problem remains insoluble within the
                              framework of Second Wave economies.

                              This helps explain the significance of the coming fusion of producer
                              and consumer—what I have called the rise of the prosumer. Third
                              Wave civilization brings with it the re-emergence of a huge economic
                              sector based on production

                              for use rather than for exchange, a sector based on do-it-for-yourself
                              rather than do-it-for-the-market. This dramatic turnabout, after 300
                              years of "marketization," will both demand and make possible radically
                              fresh thinking about all our economic problems, from unemployment
                              and welfare to leisure and the role of work.

                              It will also bring with it a changed appreciation of the role of
                              "housework" in the economy, and subsequent fundamental changes in
                              the role of women, who still comprise the vast majority of
                              houseworkers. The powerful surge of marketization across the earth is
                              cresting, with many as yet unimaginable consequences for future
                              civilizations.

                              Third Wave people, meanwhile, will adopt new assumptions about
                              nature, progress, evolution, time, space, matter, and causation. Their
                              thinking will be less influenced by analogies based on the machine,
                              more shaped by concepts like process, feedback, and disequilibrium.
                              They will be more aware of the discontinuities that flow directly out of
                              continuities.

                              A host of new religions, new conceptions of science, new images of
                              human nature, new forms of art will arise—in far richer diversity than
                              was possible or necessary during the industrial age. The emerging
                              multiculture will be torn by turmoil until new forms of group conflict
                              resolution are developed (present-day legal systems are unimaginative
                              and woefully inadequate for a high diversity society).

                              The increasing differentiation of society will also mean a reduced role
                              for the nation-state—until now a major force for standardization. Third
                              Wave civilization will be based on a new distribution of power in which
                              the nation, as such, is no longer as influential as it once was, while
                              other institutions—from the transnational corporation to the
                              autonomous neighborhood or even city-state—assume greater
                              significance.

                              Regions will gain greater power as national markets and economies
                              fracture into pieces, some of which are already larger than the national
                              markets and economies of the past. New alliances may spring up
                              based less on geographical nearness than on common cultural,
                              ecological, religious, or economic affinities, so that a region in North
                              America may develop closer ties with a region in Europe or Japan than
                              with its own next-door neighbor or—eventually—its own national
                              government. Tying this all together will be not a unitary world
                              government but a dense network of new transnational organizations.]]></page><page Index="290"><![CDATA[CODA: THE GREAT CONFLUENCE

                              THE CONCEPT OF PRACTOPIA

                              What we see here are the outlines, therefore, of a wholly new way of
                              life, affecting not only individuals but the planet MS well. The new
                              civilization sketched here can hardly be termed a Utopia. It will be
                              agitated by deep problems, some of which we will explore in the
                              remaining pages. Problems of iclf and community. Political problems.
                              Problems of justice, equity, and morality. Problems with the new
                              economy (and especially the relationship between employment,
                              welfare, and prosumption). All these and many more will arouse
                              fighting passions.

                              But Third Wave civilization is also no "anti-utopia." It is not 1984 writ
                              large or Brave New World brought to life. Moth these brilliant books—
                              and hundreds of derivative defence fiction stories—paint a future
                              based on highly central-l/.i-d, bureaucratized, and standardized
                              societies, in which individual differences are eradicated. We are now
                              heading in exactly the opposite direction.

                              While the Third Wave carries with it deep challenges for humanity,
                              from ecological threats to the danger of nuclear terrorism and
                              electronic fascism, it is not simply a nightmarish linear extension of
                              industrialism.

                              We glimpse here instead the emergence of what might be mlled a
                              "practopia"—neither the best nor the worst of all possible worlds, but
                              one that is both practical and preferable to the one we had. Unlike a
                              Utopia, a practopia is not free of

                              disease, political nastiness, and bad manners. Unlike most Utopias, it
                              is not static or frozen in unreal perfection. Nor is it reversionary,
                              modeling itself on some imagined ideal of the past.]]></page><page Index="291"><![CDATA[Conversely, a practopia does not embody the crystalized evil of a
                              Utopia turned inside out. It is not ruthlessly antidemocratic. It is not
                              inherently militarist. It does not reduce its citizens to faceless
                              uniformity. It does not destroy its neighbors and degrade its
                              environment.

                              In short, a practopia offers a positive, even a revolutionary alternative,
                              yet lies within the range of the realistically attainable.

                              Third Wave civilization, in this sense, is precisely that: a practopian
                              future. One can glimpse in it a civilization that makes allowance for
                              individual difference, and embraces (rather than suppresses) racial,
                              regional, religious, and sub-cultural variety. A civilization built in
                              considerable measure around the home. A civilization that is not frozen
                              hi amber but pulsing with innovation, yet which is also capable of
                              providing enclaves of relative stability for those who need or want
                              them. A civilization no longer required to pour its best energies into
                              marketization. A civilization capable of directing great passion into art.
                              A civilization facing unprecedented historical choices—about genetics
                              and evolution, to choose a single example—and inventing new ethical
                              or moral standards to deal with such complex issues. A civilization,
                              finally, that is at least potentially democratic and humane, hi better
                              balance with the biosphere and no longer dangerously dependent on
                              exploitative subsidies from the rest of the world. Hard work to achieve,
                              but not impossible.

                              Flowing together in grand confluence, today's changes thus point to a
                              workable countercivilization, an alternative to the increasingly obsolete
                              and unworkable industrial system.

                              They point, in a word, to practopia.

                              THE WRONG QUESTION

                              Why is this happening? Why is the old Second Wave suddenly
                              unworkable? Why is this new civilizational tide rushing in to collide with
                              the old?

                              Nobody knows. Even today, 300 long years after the fact, historians
                              cannot pin down the "cause" of the industrial revolution. As we have
                              seen, each academic guild or philosophical

                              and political changes trailing in their wake. Still others emphasize the
                              awakening of the non-industrial world and the ensuing political
                              upheavals that threaten our life lines of cheap energy and raw
                              materials.

                              One can cite striking value changes—the sexual revolution, the youth
                              upheaval of the 1960's, the swiftly shifting attitudes toward work. One
                              might single out the arms race which has greatly accelerated certain
                              types of technological change. Alternatively, one might look for the
                              cause of the Third Wave in the cultural and epistemological changes of
                              our time—perhaps as profound as those wrought by the Reformation
                              and Enlightenment combined.

                              We could, in short, find scores, even hundreds of streams of change
                              feeding into the grand confluence, all of them interrelated in mutually
                              causal ways. We could find amazing positive feedback loops in the
                              social system, vastly accelerating and amplifying certain changes, as
                              well as negative loops that suppress other changes. We could find, in
                              this period of turbulence, analogies to the grand "leap" described by
                              scientists like Ilya Prigogine, by which a simpler structure, in part by
                              chance, suddenly breaks through to a wholly new level of complexity
                              and diversity.

                              What we cannot find is "the" cause of the Third Wave hi the sense of a
                              single independent variable or link that pulls the chain. Indeed, to ask
                              what "the" cause is may be the wrong way of phrasing the question or
                              even the wrong question altogether. "What is the cause of the Third
                              Wave?" may be a Second Wave question.

                              To say this is not to discount causation but to recognize its complexity.
                              Nor does it suggest historical inevitability. Second Wave civilization
                              may be shattered and unworkable, but that does not mean that the
                              Third Wave civilization pictured here

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              must necessarily take form. Any number of forces could radically
                              change the outlook. War, economic collapse, ecological catastrophe
                              come immediately to mind. While no one can stop the latest historical
                              wave of change, necessity and chance are both at work. This,
                              however, does not mean we cannot influence its course. If what I have
                              said about positive feedback is correct, often a little "kick" to the
                              system can bring about large-scale changes.

                              The decisions we take today, as individuals, groups, or governments,
                              can deflect, divert, or channel the racing currents of change. Each
                              people will react differently to the challenges posed by the super-
                              struggle that pits advocates of the Second Wave against those of the
                              Third. Russians will respond one way, Americans another, Japanese,
                              Germans, French, or Norwegians in still other ways, and countries are
                              likely to grow more different from one another rather than more alike.]]></page><page Index="293"><![CDATA[Within countries the same is true. Little changes can trigger large
                              consequences—in corporations, schools, churches, hospitals, and
                              neighborhoods. And this is why, despite everything, people—even
                              individuals—still count.

                              This is especially true because the changes that lie ahead are the
                              consequences of conflict, not automatic progression. Thus in every
                              one of the technologically advanced nations, backward regions
                              struggle to complete then- industrialization. They attempt to protect
                              then' Second Wave factories and the jobs based on them. This places
                              them in frontal conflict with regions that are already far advanced in
                              building the technological base for Third Wave operations. Such
                              battles tear society apart, but they also open many opportunities for
                              effective political and social action.

                              The super-struggle now being waged hi every community between the
                              people of the Second Wave and the people of the Third Wave does not
                              mean that other struggles lose their importance. Class conflict, racial
                              conflict, the conflict of young and old against what I have elsewhere
                              called "the imperialism of the middle-aged," the conflict among regions,
                              sexes, religions—all these continue. Some, indeed, will be sharpened.
                              , But all of them are shaped by, and subordinated to, the su-per-
                              struggle. It is the super-struggle that most basically determines the
                              future.

                              Meanwhile, two things cut through everything as the Third Wave
                              thunders in our ears. One is the shift toward a higher level of diversity
                              in society—the de-massification of mass society. The second is
                              acceleration—the faster pace at which

                              historical change occurs. Together these place tremendous strains on
                              individuals and institutions alike, intensifying the super-struggle as it
                              rages about us.

                              Accustomed to coping with low diversity and slow change, individuals
                              and institutions suddenly find themselves trying to cope with high
                              diversity and high-speed change. The cross-pressures threaten to
                              overload their decisional competence. The result is future shock.

                              We are left with only one option. We must be willing to reshape
                              ourselves and our institutions to deal with the new realities.

                              For that is the price of admission to a workable and decently humane
                              future. To make the necessary changes, however, we must take a
                              totally fresh and imaginative look at two blazing issues. Both are
                              crucial to our survival, yet all but ignored in public discussion: the
                              future of personality and the politics of the future.

                              To which we now turn...

                              A new civilization is forming. But where do we fit into it? Don't today's
                              technological changes and social upheavals mean the end of
                              friendship, love, commitment, community, and caring? Won't
                              tomorrow's electronic marvels make human relationships even more
                              vacuous and vicarious than they are today?

                              These are legitimate questions. They arise from reasonable fears, and
                              only a naive technocrat would brush them lightly aside. For if we look
                              around us we find widespread evidence of psychological breakdown. It
                              is as though a bomb had gone off in our communal "psycho-sphere."
                              We are, in fact, experiencing not merely the breakup of the Second
                              Wave techno-sphere, info-sphere, or socio-sphere but the crack-up of
                              its psycho-sphere as well.

                              Throughout the affluent nations the litany is all too familiar: rising rates
                              of juvenile suicide, dizzyingly high levels of alcoholism, widespread
                              psychological depression, vandalism, and crime. In the United States,
                              emergency rooms are crowded with "potheads," "speed freaks" and
                              "Quaalude kids," "coke sniffers" and "heroin junkies," not to mention
                              people having "nervous breakdowns."

                              Social work and mental health industries are booming everywhere. In
                              Washington a President's Commission on Mental Health announces
                              that fully one fourth of all citizens hi Ihe United States suffer from some
                              form of severe emotional stress. And a National Institute of Mental

                              mental disorder, declares that "psychological turbulence . . . is rampant
                              in an American society that is confused, divided and concerned about
                              its future."

                              It is true that spongy definitions and unreliable statistics make such
                              sweeping generalizations suspect, and it is doubly true that earlier
                              societies were scarcely models of good mental health. Yet something
                              is terribly wrong today.

                              There is a harassed, knife-edge quality to daily life. Nerves are ragged,
                              and—as the scuffles and shootings in subways or on gas queues
                              suggest—tempers are barely under hair-trigger control. Millions of
                              people are terminally fed up.

                              They are, moreover, increasingly hassled by an apparently swelling
                              army of heavy breathers, kooks, flakes, weirdos, and psychos whose
                              antisocial behavior is frequently glamorized by the media. In the West
                              at least, we see a pernicious romanti-cization of insanity, a glorification]]></page><page Index="295"><![CDATA[of the "cuckoo nest" inmate. Best-sellers proclaim that madness is a
                              myth, and a literary journal springs up in Berkeley dedicated to the
                              notion that "Madness, Genius and Sainthood all lie in the same realm,
                              and should be given the same name and prestige."

                              Meanwhile, millions of individuals search frantically for their own
                              identities or for some magic therapy to re-integrate their personalities,
                              provide instant intimacy or ecstasy, or lead them to "higher" states of
                              consciousness.

                              By the late 1970's a human potential movement, spreading eastward
                              from California, had spawned some 8,000 different "therapies"
                              consisting of odds and ends of psychoanalysis, Eastern religion,
                              sexual experimentation, game playing, and old-time revivalism. In the
                              words of one critical survey, "these techniques were neatly packaged
                              and distributed coast to coast under names like Mind Dynamics, Arica,
                              and Silva Mind Control. Transcendental Meditation was already being
                              peddled like speed reading; Scientology's Dianetics had been mass-
                              marketing its own popular therapy since the fifties. At the same time,
                              America's religious cults got into the swing, fanning out quietly across
                              the country in massive fund-raising and recruitment drives."

                              More important than the growing human-potential industry is the
                              Christian evangelical movement. Appealing to poorer and less
                              educated segments of the public, making sophisticated use of high-
                              powered radio and television, the "bora again" movement is ballooning
                              in size. Religious hucksters, riding its crest, send their followers
                              scrambling for salvation in a society they picture as decadent and
                              doomed.

                              367

                              This wave of malaise has not struck all parts of the technological world
                              with equal force. For this reason, readers in Europe and elsewhere
                              may be tempted to shrug it off as a largely American phenomenon,
                              while in the United States itself some still regard it as just another
                              manifestation of California's fabled flakiness.

                              Neither view could be further from the truth. If psychic distress and
                              disintegration are most strikingly evident hi the United States, and
                              especially California, it merely reflects the fact that the Third Wave has
                              arrived a bit earlier than elsewhere, causing Second Wave social
                              structures to topple sooner and more spectacularly.

                              Indeed, a kind of paranoia has settled over many communities, and not
                              just in the United States. In Rome and Turin, terrorists stalk the streets.
                              In Paris, and even in once peaceful London, muggings and vandalism
                              increase. In Chicago, elderly people are afraid to walk the streets after
                              dark. In New York, schools and subways crackle with violence. And
                              hack in California, a magazine offers its readers a supposedly practical
                              guide to "handguns and gun courses, attack-trained dogs, burglar
                              alarms, personal-safety devices, self-defense courses and
                              computerized security systems."]]></page><page Index="296"><![CDATA[There is a sick odor hi the air. It is the smell of a dying Second Wave

                              THE ATTACK ON LONELINESS

                              To create a fulfilling emotional life and a sane psycho-sphere for the
                              emerging civilization of tomorrow, we must recognize three basic
                              requirements of any individual: the needs for commmumty, structure,
                              and meaning. Understanding how the collapse of Second Wave
                              society undermines all three suggests how we might begin designing a
                              healthier psychological environment for ourselves and our children in
                              the future.

                              To begin with, any decent society must generate a feeling of
                              community. Community offsets loneliness. It gives people a vitally
                              necessary sense of belonging. Yet today the institutions on which
                              community depends are crumbling in all the techno-societies. The
                              result is a spreading plague of loneliness.

                              From Los Angeles to Leningrad, teen-agers, unhappy married couples,
                              single parents, ordinary working people, and the

                              elderly, all complain of social isolation. Parents confess that their
                              children are too busy to see them or even to telephone. Lonely
                              strangers in bars or launderettes offer what one sociologist calls "those
                              infinitely sad confidences." Singles' clubs and discos serve as flesh
                              markets for desperate divorcees.

                              Loneliness is even a neglected factor in the economy. How many
                              upper-middle-class housewives, driven to distraction by the clanging
                              emptiness of then* affluent suburban homes, have gone into the job
                              market to preserve their sanity? How many pets (and carloads of pet
                              food) are bought to break the silence of an empty home? Loneliness
                              supports much of our travel and .entertainment business. It contributes
                              to drug use, depression, and declining productivity. And it creates a
                              lucrative "lonely-hearts" industry that purports to help the lonely locate
                              and lasso Mr. or Ms. "Right."

                              The hurt of being alone is, of course, hardly new. But loneliness is now
                              so widespread it has become, paradoxically, a shared experience.

                              Community demands more than emotionally satisfying bonds between
                              individuals, however. It also requires strong ties of loyalty between
                              individuals and their organizations. Just as they miss the
                              companionship of other individuals, millions today feel equally cut off
                              from the institutions of which they are a part. They hunger for
                              institutions worthy of their respect, affection, and loyalty.

                              The corporation offers a case in point.

                              As companies have grown larger and more impersonal and have
                              diversified into many disparate activities, employees have been left]]></page><page Index="297"><![CDATA[with little sense of shared mission. The feeling of community is absent.
                              The very term "corporate loyalty" has an archaic ring to it. Indeed,
                              loyalty to a company is considered by many a betrayal of self. In The
                              Bottom Line, Fletcher Knebel's popular novel about big business, the
                              heroine snaps to her executive husband: "Company loyalty! It makes
                              me want to vomit."

                              Except in Japan, where the lifetime employment system and corporate
                              paternalism still exist (though for a shrinking percentage of the labor
                              force), work relationships are increasingly transient and emotionally
                              unsatisfying. Even when companies make an effort to provide a social
                              dimension to employment—an annual picnic, a company-sponsored
                              bowling team, an office Christmas party—most on-the-job relationships
                              are no more than skin-deep.

                              For such reasons, few today have any sense of belonging to


                              THE NEW PSYCHO-SPHERE

                              369

                              something bigger and better than themselves. This warm participatory
                              feeling emerges spontaneously from time to time tluring crisis, stress,
                              disaster, or mass uprising. The great student strikes of the sixties, for
                              example, produced a glow of communal feeling. The antinuclear
                              demonstrations today do the same. But both the movements and the
                              feelings they arouse are fleeting. Community is in short supply.

                              One clue to the plague of loneliness lies in our rising level of social
                              diversity. By de-massifying society, by accentuating differences rather
                              than similarities, we help people individualize themselves. We make it
                              possible for each of us more nearly to fulfill his or her potential. But we
                              also make human contact more difficult. For the more individualized we
                              are, the more difficult it becomes to find a mate or a lover who has
                              precisely matching interests, values, schedules, or tastes. Friends are
                              also harder to come by. We become choosier in our social ties. But so
                              do others. The result is a great many ill-matched relationships. Or no
                              relationships at all.

                              The breakup of mass society, therefore, while holding out the promise
                              of much greater individual self-fulfillment, is at least for the present
                              spreading the pain of isolation. If the emergent Third Wave society is
                              not to be icily metallic, with a vacuum for a heart, it must attack this
                              problem frontally. It must restore community.

                              How might we begin to do this?

                              Once we recognize that loneliness is no longer an individual matter but
                              a public problem created by the disintegration of Second Wave
                              institutions, there are plenty of things we can do about it. We can begin
                              where community usually begins—in the family, by expanding its
                              shrunken functions.

                              The family, since the industrial revolution, has been progressively
                              relieved of the burden of its elderly. If we stripped this responsibility]]></page><page Index="298"><![CDATA[from the family, perhaps the time has come to restore it partially. Only
                              a nostalgic fool would favor dismantling public and private pension
                              systems, or making old people completely dependent on their families
                              as they once were. But why not offer tax and other incentives for
                              families—including non-nuclear and unconventional families —who
                              look after their own elderly instead of farming them out to impersonal
                              old-age "homes." Why not reward, rather than economically punish,
                              those who maintain and solidify family bonds across generational
                              lines?

                              370

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              The same principle can be extended to other functions of the family as
                              well. Families should be encouraged to take a larger—not smaller—
                              role in the education of the young. Parents willing to teach their own
                              children at home should be aided by the schools, not regarded as
                              freaks or lawbreakers. And parents should have more, not less,
                              influence on the schools.

                              At the same time much could be done by the schools themselves to
                              create a sense of belonging. Instead of grading students purely on
                              individual performance, some part of each student's grade could be
                              made dependent on the performance of the class as a whole or some
                              team within it. This would give early and overt support to the idea that
                              each of us has responsibility for others. With a bit of encouragement,
                              imaginative educators could come up with many other, better ways to
                              promote a sense of community.

                              Corporations, too, could do much to begin building human ties afresh.
                              Third Wave production makes possible decentralization and smaller,
                              more personal work units. Innovative companies might build morale
                              and a sense of belonging by asking groups of workers to organize
                              themselves into mini-companies or cooperatives and contracting
                              directly with these groups to get specific jobs done.

                              This breakup of huge corporations into small, self-managed units could
                              not merely unleash enormous new productive energies but build
                              community at the same time.

                              Norman Macrae, deputy editor of The Economist, has suggested that
                              "Semi-autonomous teams of perhaps six to 17 people, who choose to
                              work together as friends, should be told by market forces what module
                              of output will be paid for at what pay rates per unit of output, and then
                              should increasingly be allowed to produce it in their own way."

                              Indeed, continues Macrae, "those who devise successful group
                              friendship cooperatives will do a lot of social good, and perhaps will
                              deserve some subsidies or tax advantages." (What is particularly
                              interesting about such arrangements is that one could create
                              cooperatives within a profit-making corporation or, for that matter,
                              profit-making companies within the framework of a socialist production
                              enterprise.)]]></page><page Index="299"><![CDATA[Corporations could also look hard at their retirement practices. Ejecting
                              an elderly worker all at once not only deprives the individual of a
                              regular, full-size paycheck, and takes away what society regards as a
                              productive role, but also truncates many social ties. Why not more
                              partial retirement plans, and

                              THE NEW PSYCHO-SPHERE

                              371

                              programs that assign semi-retired people to work for understaffed
                              community services on a volunteer or part-pay basis?

                              Another community-building device might draw retired people into
                              fresh contact with the young, and vice versa. Older people in every
                              community could be appointed "adjunct teachers" or "mentors," invited
                              to teach some of their skills in local schools on a part-time or volunteer
                              basis or to have one student, let's say, regularly visit them for
                              instruction. Under school supervision, retired photographers could
                              teach photography, car mechanics how to repair a recalcitrant engine,
                              bookkeepers how to keep books, and so on. In many cases a healthy
                              bond would grow up between mentor and "mentee" that would go
                              beyond instruction.

                              It is not a sin to be lonely and, in a society whose structures are fast
                              disintegrating, it should not be a disgrace. Thus a letter writer to the
                              Jewish Chronicle in London asks: "Why does it seem 'not quite nice' to
                              go to groups where it is perfectly obvious that the reason that everyone
                              is there is to meet people of the opposite sex?" The same question
                              would apply to singles' bars, discos, and holiday resorts.

                              The letter points out that hi the shtetls of Eastern Europe the institution
                              of shadchan or matchmaker served a useful purpose in bringing
                              marriageable people together, and that dating bureaus, marriage
                              services, and similar agencies are just as necessary today. "We should
                              be able to admit openly that we need help, human contact and a social
                              life."

                              We need many new services—both traditional and innovative—to help
                              bring lonely people together in a dignified way. Some people now rely
                              on "lonely-hearts" ads in the magazines to help them locate a
                              companion or mate. Before long we can be sure local or neighborhood
                              cable television services •will be running video ads so prospective
                              partners can actually see each other before dating. (Such programs,
                              one suspects, will have enormously high ratings.)

                              But should dating services be limited to providing romantic contacts?
                              Why not services—or places—where people might come simply to
                              meet and make a friend, as distinct from a lover or potential mate?
                              Society needs such services and, so long as they are honest and
                              decent, we should not be embarrassed to invent and use them.

                              372 THE THIRD WAVE

                              TELECOMMUNITY]]></page><page Index="300"><![CDATA[At the level of longer-term social policy we should also move rapidly
                              toward "telecommunity." Those who wish community restored should
                              concentrate attention on the socially fragmenting impact of commuting
                              and high mobility. Having written in detail about this in Future Shock, I
                              will not retrace the argument. But one of the key steps that can be
                              taken toward building a sense of community into the Third Wave is the
                              selective substitution of communication for transportation.

                              The popular fear that computers and telecommunications will deprive
                              us of face-to-face contact and make human relations more vicarious is
                              naive and simplistic. In fact, the reverse might very well be the case.
                              While some office or factory relationships might be attenuated, bonds
                              in the home and the community could well be strengthened by these
                              new technologies. Computers and communications can help us create
                              community.

                              If nothing else, they can free larger numbers of us to give up
                              commuting—the centrifugal force that disperses us hi the morning,
                              throws us into superficial work relationships, while weakening our more
                              important social ties in the home and community. By making it possible
                              for large numbers of people to work at home (or in close-by
                              neighborhood work centers), the new technologies could make for
                              warmer, more bonded families and a closer, more finely grained
                              community life. The electronic cottage may turn out to be the
                              characteristic mom-and-pop business of the future. And it could lead,
                              as we have seen, to a new work-together family unit involving children
                              (and sometimes even expanded to take in outsiders as well).

                              It is not unlikely that couples who spend a lot of time working together
                              hi the home during the day will want to go out in the evening. (Today
                              the more typical pattern is for the commuter to collapse on returning
                              home and refuse to set foot outside.) As communications begin to
                              replace commuting, we can expect to see a lively proliferation of
                              neighborhood restaurants, theaters, pubs, and clubs, a revitalization of
                              church and voluntary group activity—all or mostly on a face-to-face
                              basis.

                              Nor, for that matter, are all vicarious relationships to be despised. The
                              issue is not simply vicariousness, but passivity and powerlessness. For
                              a shy person or an invalid, unable to

                              who share similar interests—chess players, stamp collectors, poetry

                              telecommunity.

                              In short, as we build a Third Wave civilization there are many things we
                              can do to sustain and enrich, rather than destroy, community.

                              THE HEROIN STRUCTURE

                              The reconstruction of community, however, must be seen as only a
                              small part of a larger process. For the collapse of Second Wave
                              institutions also breaks down structure and meaning in our lives.

                              Individuals need life structure. A life lacking in comprehensible
                              structure is an aimless wreck. The absence of structure breeds
                              breakdown.

                              Structure provides the relatively fixed points of reference we need.
                              That is why, for many people, a job is crucial psychologically, over and
                              above the paycheck. By making clear demands on their time and
                              energy, it provides an element of structure around which the rest of
                              their lives can be organized. The absolute demands imposed on a
                              parent by an infant, the responsibility to care for an invalid, the tight
                              discipline demanded by membership in a church or, in some countries,
                              a political party—all these may also impose a simple structure on life.

                              Faced with an absence of visible structure, some young people use
                              drugs to create it. "Heroin addiction," writes psychologist Rollo May,
                              "gives a way of life to the young person.. Having suffered under
                              perpetual purposelessness, his structure now consists of how to
                              escape the cops, how to get the money he needs, where to get his
                              next fix—all these give him a new web of energy in place of his
                              previous structureless world."

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              The nuclear family, socially imposed schedules, well-defined roles,
                              visible status distinctions, and comprehensible lines of authority—all
                              these factors created adequate life structure for the majority of people
                              during the Second Wave era.

                              Today the breakup of the Second Wave is dissolving the structure in
                              many individual lives before the new structure-providing institutions of
                              the Third Wave future are laid into place. This, not merely some
                              personal failing, explains why for millions today daily life is experienced
                              as lacking any semblance of recognizable order.

                              To this loss of order we must also add the loss of meaning. The feeling
                              that our lives "count" comes from healthy relationships with the
                              surrounding society—from family, corporation, church, or political
                              movement. It also depends on being able to see ourselves as part of a
                              larger, even cosmic, scheme of things.

                              The sudden shift of social ground rules today, the smudging of roles,
                              status distinctions, and lines of authority, the immersion hi blip culture]]></page><page Index="302"><![CDATA[and, above all, the breakup of the great thought-system, indust-reality,
                              have shattered the world-image most of us carry around in our skulls.
                              In consequence, most people surveying the world around them today
                              see only chaos. They suffer a sense of personal powerlessness and
                              pointlessness.

                              It is only when we put all this together—the loneliness, the loss of
                              structure, and the collapse of meaning attendant on the decline of
                              industrial civilization—that we can begin to make sense of some of the
                              most puzzling social phenomena of our time, not the least of which is
                              the astonishing rise of the cult

                              THE SECRET OF THE CULTS

                              Why do so many thousands of apparently intelligent, seemingly
                              successful people allow themselves to be sucked into the myriad cults
                              sprouting today in the widening cracks of the Second Wave system?
                              What accounts for the total control that a Jim Jones was able to
                              exercise over the lives of his followers?

                              It is loosely estimated today that some 3,000,000 Americans belong to
                              about 1,000 religious cults, the largest of which bear names like the
                              Unification Church, the Divin*

                              Light Mission, the Hare Krishna, and the Way, each of which has
                              temples or branches in most major cities. One of them alone, Sun
                              Myung Moon's Unification Church, claims 60,000 to 80,000 members,
                              publishes a daily newspaper in New York, owns a fish-packing plant in
                              Virginia, and has many other money-creating enterprises. Its
                              mechanically cheerful fund raisers are a common sight.

                              Nor are such groups confined to the United States. A recent
                              sensational lawsuit in Switzerland called international attention to the
                              Divine Light Center in Winterthur. "The cults and sects and
                              communities . . . are most numerous in the United States because
                              America is, in this matter, too, 20 years ahead of the rest of the world,"
                              says the London Economist. "But they are to be found in Europe, west
                              and east, and in many other places." Just why is it that such groups
                              can command almost total dedication and obedience from their
                              members? Their secret is simple. They understand the need for
                              community, structure, and meaning. For these are what all cults
                              peddle.

                              For lonely people, cults offer, in the beginning, indiscriminate
                              friendship. Says an official of the Unification Church: "If someone's
                              lonely, we talk to them. There are a lot of lonely people walking
                              around." The newcomer is surrounded by people offering friendship
                              and beaming approval. Many of the cults require communal living. So
                              powerfully rewarding is (his sudden warmth and attention that cult
                              members are often willing to give up contact with their families and
                              former friends, to donate their life's earnings to the cult, to forego drugs
                              and even sex in return.]]></page><page Index="303"><![CDATA[But the cult sells more than community. It also offers much-needed
                              structure. Cults impose tight constraints on behavior. They demand
                              and create enormous discipline, some apparently going so far as to
                              impose that discipline through heatings, forced labor, and their own
                              forms of ostracism or Imprisonment. Psychiatrist H. A. S. Sukhdeo of
                              the New Jer-Nt-y School of Medicine, after interviewing survivors of the

                              example," Harris said, "of what some Americans will subject
                              themselves to in order to bring some structure into their lives."

                              The last vital product marketed by the cults is "meaning." Each has its
                              own single-minded version of reality—religious, political, or cultural.
                              The cult possesses the sole truth and those living in the outside world
                              who fail to recognize the value of that truth are pictured as either
                              misinformed or Satanic. The message of the cult is drummed into the
                              new member at all-day, all-night sessions. It is preached incessantly,
                              until he or she begins to use its terms of reference, its vocabulary,
                              and—ultimately—its metaphor for existence. The "meaning" delivered
                              by the cult may be absurd to the out* sider. But that doesn't matter.

                              Indeed, the exact, pinned-down content of the cult message is almost
                              incidental. Its power lies in providing synthesis, in offering an
                              alternative to the fragmented blip culture around us. Once the
                              framework is accepted by the cult recruit, it helps organize much of the
                              chaotic information bombarding him or her from the outside. Whether
                              or not that framework of ideas corresponds to outer reality, it provides
                              a neat set of cubbyholes in which the member can store incoming
                              data. It thereby relieves the stress of overload and confusion. It
                              provides not truth, as such, but order, and thus meaning:

                              By giving the cult member a sense that reality is meaningful—and that
                              he or she must carry that meaning to outsiders—the cult offers
                              purpose and coherence in a seemingly incoherent world.

                              The cult, however, sells community, structure, and meaning at an
                              extremely high price: the mindless surrender of self. For some, no
                              doubt, this is the only alternative to personal disintegration. But for
                              most of us title cult's way out is too costly.

                              To make Third Wave civilization both sane and democratic, we need to
                              do more than create new energy supplies or plug in new technology.
                              We need to do more than create community. We need to provide
                              structure and meaning as well. And once again there are simple things
                              we can do to get started.]]></page><page Index="304"><![CDATA[LIFE-ORGANIZERS AND SEMI-CULTS At the very simplest and most

                              For example, we probably need fewer psychother-apists burrowing
                              mole-like into id and ego, and more people who can help us, even in
                              little ways, to pull our daily lives to-gether. Among the most widely
                              heard don't-you-believe-it phrases in use today are: "Tomorrow I'll get
                              myself or-ganized" or "I'm getting my act together."

                              Vet structuring one's life under today's conditions of high social and
                              technological turmoil is harder and hajder to do. The breakup of normal
                              Second Wave structures., the over-choice of life-styles, schedules, and
                              educational opportunities—all, as we have seen, increase the difficulty.
                              For the less affluent, economic pressures impose high structure. For
                              the middle class, and especially their children, the reverse is true. Why
                              not recognize this fact?

                              Some psychiatrists today perform a life-organizing function. Instead of
                              years on the couch, they offer practical assistance in finding work,
                              locating a girl or boyfriend, budgeting one's money, following a diet,
                              and so forth. We need many more such consultants, structure-
                              providers, and we need feel no shame about seeking their services.

                              In education, we need to begin paying attention to matters routinely
                              ignored. We spend long hours trying to teach a variety of courses on,
                              say, the structure of government or the structure of the amoeba. But
                              how much effort goes into studying the structure of everyday life—the
                              way time is allocated, the personal uses of money, the places to go for
                              help in a society exploding with complexity? We take for granted that
                              young people already know their way around our social structure. In
                              fact, most have only the dimmest image of the way the world of work or
                              business is organized. Most students have no conception of the
                              architecture of their own city's economy, or the way the local
                              bureaucracy operates, or the place to go to lodge a complaint against
                              a merchant. Most do not even understand how their own schools—
                              even universities—are structured, let alone how much structures are
                              changing under the impact of the Third Wave.

                              We also need to take a fresh look at structure-providing institutions—
                              including cults. A sensible society should provide a spectrum of
                              institutions, ranging from those that are free-form to those that are
                              tightly structured. We need open classrooms as well as traditional
                              schools. We need easy-come-easy-go organizations as well as rigid
                              monastic orders (secular as well as religious).

                              seemingly total structurelessness of daily life may well be too wide.

                              If we find the complete subjugation demanded by many cults to be
                              repellent, we should perhaps encourage the formation of what might
                              be called "semi-cults" that lie somewhere between structureless
                              freedom and tightly structured regimentation. Religious organizations,
                              vegetarians, and other sects or groupings might actually be
                              encouraged to form communities in which moderate to high structure is
                              imposed on those who wish to live that way. These semi-cults might be
                              licensed or monitored to assure that they do not engage in physical or
                              mental violence, embezzlement, extortion, or other such practices, and
                              could be set up so that people in need of external structure can join
                              them for a six-month or one-year hitch—and then leave without
                              pressure or recriminations.

                              Some people might find it helpful to live within a semi-cult for a time,
                              then return to the outside world, then plug back into the organization
                              for a time, and so forth, alternating between the demands of high,
                              imposed structure and the freedom offered by the larger society.
                              Should this not be possible for them?

                              Such semi-cults also suggest the need for secular organizations that
                              lie somewhere between the freedom of civilian life and the discipline of
                              the army. Why not a variety of civilian service corps, perhaps
                              organized by cities, school systems, or even private companies to
                              perform useful community services on a contract basis, employing
                              young people who might live together under strict disciplinary rules and
                              be paid army-scale wages. (To bring these paychecks up to the
                              prevailing minimum wage, corps members might receive
                              supplementary vouchers good for university tuition or training.) A
                              "pollution corps," a "public sanitation corps," a "paramedic corps,'* or a
                              corps designed to assist the elderly—such organizations could yield
                              high dividends for both community and individual.

                              In addition to providing useful services and a degree of life-structure,
                              such organizations could also help bring much-needed meaning into
                              the lives of their members—not some spurious mystical or political
                              theology but the simple ideal of service to community.

                              Beyond all such measures, however, we shall need to integrate
                              personal meaning with larger, more encompassing world views. It is
                              not enough for people to understand (or think

                              THE NEW PSYCHO-SPHERE

                              also have some sense, even if inarticulate, of how they fit into the
                              larger scheme of things. As the Third Wave arrives we will need to
                              formulate sweeping new integrative world views—coherent syntheses,
                              not merely blips—that tie things together.

                              No single world view can ever capture the whole truth. Only by
                              applying multiple and temporary metaphors can we gain a rounded (if]]></page><page Index="306"><![CDATA[still incomplete) picture of the world. But to acknowledge this axiom is
                              not the same as saying life is meaningless. Indeed, even if life is
                              meaningless hi some cosmic sense, we can and often do construct
                              meaning, drawing it from decent social relations and picturing
                              ourselves as part of a larger drama—the coherent unfolding of history.

                              In building Third Wave civilization, therefore, we must ga beyond the
                              attack on loneliness. We must also begin providing a framework of
                              order and purpose in life. For meaning, structure, and community are
                              interrelated preconditions for a livable future.

                              In working toward these ends, it will help to understand that the
                              present agony of social isolation, the impersonality, structurelessness,
                              and sense of meaninglessness from which so many people suffer are
                              symptoms of the breakdown of the past rather than intimations of the
                              future.

                              It will not be enough, however, for us to change society. For as we
                              shape Third Wave civilization through our own daily decisions and
                              actions, Third Wave civilization will hi turn shape us. A new psycho-
                              sphere is emerging that will fundamentally alter our character. And it is
                              to this—the personality of the future—that we next turn.

                              THE PERSONALITY OF THE FUTURE

                              As a novel civilization erupts into our everyday lives we are left
                              wondering whether we, too, are obsolete. With so many of our habits,
                              values, routines, and responses called into question, it is hardly
                              surprising if we sometimes feel like people of the past, relics of Second
                              Wave civilization. But if some of us are indeed anachronisms, are there
                              also people of the future among us—anticipatory citizens, as it were, of
                              the Third Wave civilization to come? Once we look past the decay and
                              disintegration around us, can we see the emerging outlines of the
                              personality of the future—the coming, so to speak, of a "new man"?

                              If so, it would not be the first time un homme nouveau was supposedly
                              detected on the horizon. In a brilliant essay, Andre Reszler, director of
                              the Center for European Culture, has described earlier attempts to
                              forecast the coming of a new type of human being. At the end of the
                              eighteenth century there was, for example, the "American Adam"—
                              man born anew in North America, supposedly without the vices and
                              weaknesses of the European. In the middle of the twentieth century,
                              the new man was supposed to appear in Hitler's Germany. Nazism,
                              wrote Hermann Rauschning, "is more than a religion; it is the will to
                              create the superman." This sturdy "Aryan" would be part peasant, part
                              warrior, part God. "I have seen the new man," Hitler once confided to
                              Rauschning. "He is intrepid and cruel. I stood in fear before him."

                              The image of a new man (few ever speak of a "new woman," except as
                              an afterthought) also haunted the Com-380

                              was Trotsky who rhapsodized most vividly about the future human.
                              "Man will become incomparably stronger, wiser and more perceptive.
                              His body will become more harmonious, his movements more
                              rhythmical, his voice more melodious. His ways of life will acquire a
                              powerfully dramatic quality. The average man will attain the level of an
                              Aristotle, of a Goethe, of a Marx."

                              As recently as a decade or two ago, Frantz Fanon heralded the coming
                              of yet another new man who would have a "new mind." Che Guevara
                              saw his ideal man of the future as having a richer interior life. Each
                              image is different.

                              Yet Reszler persuasively points out that behind most of these images
                              of the "new man" there lurks that familiar old fellow, the Noble Savage,
                              a mythic creature endowed with all sorts of qualities that civilization
                              has supposedly corrupted or worn away. Reszler properly questions
                              this romanticization of the primitive, reminding us that regimes which
                              set out consciously to foster a "new man" have usually brought
                              totalitarian havoc in then* wake.

                              It would be foolish, therefore, to herald yet once more the birth of a
                              "new man" (unless, now that the genetic engineers are at work, we
                              mean that in a frightening, strictly biological sense). The idea suggests
                              a prototype, a single ideal model that the entire civilization strains to
                              emulate. And in a society moving rapidly toward de-massification,
                              nothing is more unlikely.

                              Nevertheless, it would be equally foolish to believe that fundamentally
                              changed material conditions of life leave personality or, more
                              accurately, social character, unaffected. As we change the deep
                              structure of society, we also modify people. Even if one believed in
                              some unchanging human nature, a commonly held view I do not share,
                              society would still reward and elicit certain character traits and penalize
                              others, leading to evolutionary changes in the distribution of traits in
                              the population.

                              The psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, who has perhaps written best about
                              social character, defines it as "that part of their character structure that
                              is common to most members of the group." In any culture, he tells us,
                              there are widely shared traits that make up the social character. In
                              turn, social character shapes people so that "men* behavior is not a
                              matter of conscious decision as to whether or not to follow the social
                              pattern, but one of wanting to act as they have to act and at

                              requirements of the culture."

                              What the Third Wave is doing, therefore, is not creating some ideal
                              superman, some new heroic species stalking through our midst, but
                              producing dramatic changes in the traits distributed through society—
                              not a new man but a new social character. Our task, therefore, is not to]]></page><page Index="308"><![CDATA[hunt for the mythic "man" but for the traits most likely to be valued by
                              the civilization of tomorrow.

                              These character traits do not simply arise from (or reflect) outside
                              pressures on people. They spring from the tension that exists between
                              the inner drives or desires of many individuals and the outer drives or
                              pressures of the society. But once formed, these shared character
                              traits play an influential role in the economic and social development of
                              the society.

                              The coming of the Second Wave, for example, was accom panied by
                              the spread of the Protestant Ethic with its emphasis on thrift,
                              unremitting toil, and the deferral of gratification-traits which channeled
                              enormous energies into the tasks of economic development. The
                              Second Wave also brought changes in objectivity-subjectivity,
                              individualism, attitudes toward authority, and the ability to think
                              abstractly, to empathize and to imagine.

                              For peasants to be machined into an industrial work force, they had to
                              be given the rudiments of literacy. They had to be educated, informed,
                              and molded. They had to understand that another way of life was
                              possible. Large numbers of people were needed, therefore, with the
                              capacity to imagine themselves in a new role and setting. Their minds
                              had to be liberated from the proximate present. Thus, just as to some
                              extent it had to democratize communications and politics, industrialism
                              was also forced to democratize the imagination.

                              The result of such psychocultural changes was a changed distribution
                              of traits—a new social character. And today we are once more at the
                              edge of a similar psychocultural upheaval.

                              The fact that we are racing away from Second Wave Orwellian
                              uniformity makes it difficult to generalize about the emerging psyche.
                              Here, even more than elsewhere in dealing with the future, we can only
                              speculate.

                              Nevertheless, we can point to powerful changes that are likely to
                              influence psychological development in Third Wave society. And this
                              leads us to fascinating questions, if not con-

                              fusions. For these changes affect child-rearing, education,
                              adolescence, work, and even the way we form our own self-images.
                              And it is impossible to change all these without deeply altering the
                              entire social character of the future.

                              To begin with, the child of tomorrow is likely to grow up In a society far
                              less child-centered than our own.

                              The "graying" or aging of the population in all high-technology
                              countries implies greater public attention to the needs of the elderly]]></page><page Index="309"><![CDATA[and a correspondingly reduced focus on the young. Furthermore, as
                              women develop jobs or careers in the exchange economy, the
                              traditional need to channel all their energies into motherhood is
                              diminished.

                              During the Second Wave, millions of parents lived out their own
                              dreams through their children—often because they could reasonably
                              expect their children to do better socially and economically than they
                              themselves had done. This expectation of upward mobility encouraged
                              parents to concentrate enormous psychic energies on their children.
                              Today many middle-class parents face agonizing disillusionment as
                              their children—in a far more difficult world—move down, rather than
                              up, the socio-economic scale. The likelihood of surrogate fulfillment is
                              evaporating.

                              For these reasons, the baby born tomorrow is likely to enter a society
                              no longer obsessed with—perhaps not even terribly interested in—the
                              needs, wants, psychological developments, and instant gratification of
                              the child. If so, the Dr. Spocks of tomorrow will urge a more structured
                              and demand-ing childhood. Parents will be less permissive.

                              Nor, one suspects, will adolescence be as prolonged and painful a
                              process as it is today for so many. Millions of children are being
                              brought up in single-parent homes, with working mothers (or fathers)
                              squeezed by an erratic economy, and with less of the luxury and time
                              available to the flower child generation of the 1960's.

                              Others, later on, are likely to be reared in work-at-home or electronic-
                              cottage families. Just as in many Second Wave families built around a
                              mom-and-pop business, we can expect the children of tomorrow's
                              electronic cottage to be drawn directly into the family's work tasks and
                              given growing responsibility from an early age.

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              Such facts suggest a shorter childhood and youth but a more
                              responsible and productive one. Working alongside adults, children in
                              such homes are also likely to be less subject to peer pressures. They
                              may well turn out to be the high achievers of tomorrow.

                              During the transition to the new society, wherever jobs remain scarce,
                              Second Wave labor unions will undoubtedly fight to exclude young
                              people from the job market outside the home. Unions (and teachers,
                              whether unionized or not) will lobby for ever-longer years of
                              compulsory or near-compulsory schooling. To the extent that they
                              succeed, millions of young people will continue to be forced into the
                              painful limbo of prolonged adolescence. We may, therefore, see a
                              sharp contrast between young people who grow up fast because of
                              early work responsibilities in the electronic cottage and those who
                              mature more slowly outside.

                              Over the long pull, however, we can expect education also to change.
                              More learning will occur outside, rather than inside, the classroom.
                              Despite the pressure from unions, the years of compulsory schooling]]></page><page Index="310"><![CDATA[will grow shorter, not longer. Instead of rigid age segregation, young
                              and old will mingle. Education will become more interspersed and
                              interwoven with work, and more spread out over a lifetime. And work
                              itself—whether production for the market or presumption for use in the
                              home—will probably begin earlier hi life than it has in the last
                              generation or two. For just such reasons, Third Wave civilization may
                              well favor quite different traits among the young—less responsiveness
                              to peers, less consumption-orientation, and less hedonistic self-
                              involvement.

                              Whether this is so or not, one thing is certain. Growing up will be
                              different. And so will the resultant personalities.

                              THE NEW WORKER

                              As the adolescent matures and enters the job arena, new forces come
                              into play on his or her personality, rewarding some traits and punishing
                              or penalizing others.

                              Throughout the Second Wave era, work in the factories and offices
                              steadily grew more repetitive, specialized, and time-pressured, and
                              employers wanted workers who were obedient, punctual, and willing to
                              perform rote tasks. The corresponding traits were fostered by the
                              schools and rewarded by the corporation.

                              THE PERSONALITY OF THE FUTURE 385

                              As the Third Wave cuts across our society, work grows less, not more,
                              repetitive. It becomes less fragmented, with each person doing a
                              somewhat larger, rather than smaller, task. Flextime and self-pacing
                              replace the old need for mass synchronization of behavior. Workers
                              are forced to cope with more frequent changes in their tasks, as well
                              as a blinding succession of personnel transfers, product changes, and
                              reorganizations.

                              What Third Wave employers increasingly need, therefore, are men and
                              women who accept responsibility, who under-stand how their work
                              dovetails with that of others, who can handle ever larger tasks, who
                              adapt swiftly to changed circumstances, and who are sensitively tuned
                              hi to the people around them.

                              The Second Wave firm frequently paid off for plodding bureaucratic
                              behavior. The Third Wave firm requires people who are less pre-
                              programmed and faster on their feet. The difference, says Donald
                              Conover, general manager of Corporate Education for Western
                              Electric, is like that between classical musicians who play each note
                              according to a predetermined, pre-set pattern, and jazz improvisers
                              who, once having decided what song to play, sensitively pick up cues
                              from one another and, on the basis of that, decide what notes to play
                              next.

                              Such people are complex, individualistic, proud of the ways in which
                              they differ from other people. They typify the de-massified work force
                              needed by Third Wave industry.]]></page><page Index="311"><![CDATA[According to opinion researcher Daniel Yankelovich, only 56 percent of
                              U.S. workers—mainly the older ones—are still motivated by traditional
                              incentives. They are happiest with strict work guidelines and clear
                              tasks. They do not expect to find "meaning" in their work.

                              By contrast, as much as 17 percent of the work force already reflects
                              newer values emerging from the Third Wave. Largely young middle-
                              managers, they are, declares Yankelovich, the "hungriest for more
                              responsibility and more vital work with a commitment worthy of their
                              talent and skills." They seek meaning along with financial reward.

                              To recruit such workers, employers are beginning to offer
                              individualized rewards. This helps explain why a few advanced
                              companies (like TRW Inc., the Cleveland-based high-technology firm)
                              now offer employees not a fixed set of fringe benefits but a
                              smorgasbord of optional holidays, medical benefits, pensions, and
                              insurance. Each worker can tailor

                              a package to his or her own needs. Says Yankelovich, "There is no
                              one set of incentives with which to motivate the full spectrum of the
                              work force." Moreover, he adds, in the mix of rewards for work, money
                              no longer has the same motivating power it once did.

                              No one suggests these workers don't want money. They certainly do.
                              But once a certain income level is reached they vary widely in what
                              they want. Additional increments of money no longer have their former
                              impact on behavior. When the Bank of America in San Francisco
                              offered assistant vice-president Richard Easley a promotion to a
                              branch only 20 miles away, Easley refused to accept the carrot. He
                              didn't want to commute. A decade ago, when Future Shock first
                              described the stress of job mobility, only an estimated 10 percent of
                              employees resisted a corporate move. The number has Jumped to
                              between a third and a half, according to Merrill Lynch Relocation
                              Management, Inc., even though moves are often accompanied by a
                              fatter-than-usual raise. "The balance has definitely shifted away from
                              saluting the company and marching off to Timbuctu toward a greater
                              emphasis on family and life-style," says a vice-president of the
                              Celanese Corporation. Like the Third Wave corporation, which must
                              respond to more than profit, the employee, too, has "multiple bottom
                              lines."

                              Meanwhile, the most ingrained patterns of authority are also changing.
                              In Second Wave firms every employee has a single boss. Disputes
                              among employees are taken to the boss to be resolved. In the new
                              matrix organizations the style is entirely different. Workers have more
                              than one boss at a time. People of different rank and different skills
                              meet in temporary, "ad-hocratic" groups. And in the words of Davis and
                              Lawrence, authors of a standard text on the subject: "Differences . ..
                              are resolved without a common boss readily available to arbitrate. ...
                              The assumption in a matrix is that this conflict can be healthy . . .
                              differences are valued and people express their views even when they
                              know that others may disagree."]]></page><page Index="312"><![CDATA[This system penalizes workers who show blind obedience. It rewards

                              system—a change which cannot help but shape the emerging social
                              character.

                              THE PROSUMER ETHIC

                              It is not just child-rearing, education, and work that will influence
                              personality development in Third Wave civilization. Even deeper forces
                              are playing on tomorrow's psyche. For there is more to the economy
                              than jobs or paid work.

                              I suggested earlier that we might conceive of the economy as having
                              two sectors, one in which we produce goods for exchange, the other in
                              which we do things for ourselves. One is Ihe market or production
                              sector, the other the prosumer sector. And each has its own
                              psychological effects on us. For each promotes its own ethic, its own
                              set of values, and its own definition of success.

                              During the Second Wave the vast expansion of the market economy—
                              both capitalist and socialist—encouraged an acquisitive ethic. It gave
                              rise to a narrowly economic definition of personal success.

                              The advance of the Third Wave, however, is accompanied, as we have
                              seen, by a phenomenal increase in self-help and do-it-yourself activity,
                              or presumption. Beyond mere hobby-ism, this production for use is
                              likely to assume greater economic significance. And as it comes to
                              occupy more of our time and energy, it too begins to shape lives and
                              mold social character.

                              Instead of ranking people by what they own, as the market ethic does,
                              the prosumer ethic places a high value on what they do. Having plenty
                              of money still carries prestige. But other characteristics count, too.
                              Among these are self-reliance, the ability to adapt and survive under
                              difficult conditions, and the ability to do things with one's own hands—
                              whether to build a fence, to cook a great meal, to make one's own
                              clothes, or to restore an antique chest.

                              Moreover, while the production or market ethic praises
                              singlemindness, the prosumer ethic calls for roundedness instead.
                              Versatility is "in." As the Third Wave brings production for exchange
                              and production for use into a better balance in the economy, we begin
                              to hear a crescendo of demands for a "balanced" way of life.]]></page><page Index="313"><![CDATA[388

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              This shift of activity from the production sector to the pro-sumption
                              sector also suggests the coming of another kind of : balance into
                              people's lives. Growing numbers of workers engaged in producing for
                              the market spend their time dealing with abstractions—words,
                              numbers, models—and people known only slightly, if at all.

                              For many, such "headwork" can be fascinating and rewarding. But it is
                              often accompanied by the sense of being dissociated—cut off, as it
                              were, from the down-to-earth sights, sounds, textures, and emotions of
                              everyday existence. Indeed, much of today's glorification of handcrafts,
                              gardening, peasant or blue-collar fashions, and what might be called
                              "truck-driver chic" may be a compensation for the rising tide of
                              abstraction in the production sector.

                              By contrast, in presumption we usually deal with a more concrete,
                              immediate reality—in firsthand contact with things and people. As more
                              people divide their time, serving as part-time workers and part-time
                              prosumers, they are in a position to enjoy the concrete along with the
                              abstract, the complementary pleasures of both headwork and
                              handwork. The prosumer ethic makes handwork respectable again,
                              after 300 years of being looked down upon. And this new balance, too,
                              is likely to influence the distribution of personality traits.

                              Similarly, we have seen that with the rise of industrialism, the spread of
                              highly interdependent factory work encouraged men to become
                              objective, while staying home and working at low-interdependency
                              tasks promoted subjectivity among women. Today, as more women
                              are drawn into jobs producing for the marketplace, they too are
                              increasingly objec-tivized. They are encouraged to "think like a man.**
                              Conversely, as more men stay home, undertaking a greater share of
                              the housework, their need for "objectivity" is lessened. They are
                              "subjectivized."

                              Tomorrow, as many Third Wave people divide their lives between
                              working part-time in big, interdependent companies or organizations
                              and working part-time for self and family hi small autonomous,
                              presuming units—we may well strike a new balance between
                              objectivity and subjectivity in both sexes.

                              Instead of finding a "male" attitude and a "female" attitude, neither of
                              them well-balanced, the system may reward people who are healthily
                              able to see the world through both perspectives. Objective
                              subjectivists—and vice versa.

                              In short, with the rising importance of presumption to the

                              change. The combined impact of basic changes in production and
                              presumption, added to the deep changes in child-rearing and
                              education, promises to remake our social character at least as
                              dramatically as the Second Wave did 100 years ago. A new social
                              character is cropping up in our very midst.

                              In fact, even if every one of these insights were to prove mistaken, if
                              every one of the shifts we are beginning to see were to reverse itself,
                              there is still one final, giant reason to expect an eruption in the psycho-
                              sphere. That reason is summed up in the two words "communications
                              revolution."

                              THE CONFIGURATIVE ME

                              The link between communications and character is complex, but
                              unbreakable. We cannot transform all our media of communication and
                              expect to remain unchanged as a people. A revolution in the media
                              must mean a revolution in the psyche.

                              During the Second Wave period, people were bathed in a sea of mass-
                              produced imagery. A relatively few centrally produced newspapers,
                              magazines, radio and television broadcasts, and movies fed what
                              critics termed a *'monolithic consciousness." Individuals were
                              continually encouraged to compare themselves to a relatively small
                              number of role models, and to evaluate their life-styles against a few
                              preferred possibilities. In consequence, the range of socially approved
                              personality styles was relatively narrow.

                              The de-massification of the media today presents a dazzling diversity
                              of role models and life-styles for one to measure oneself against.
                              Moreover, the new media do not feed us fully formed chunks, but
                              broken chips and blips of imagery. Instead of being handed a selection
                              of coherent identities to choose among, we are required to piece one
                              together: a con-figurative or modular "me." This is far more difficult,
                              and it explains why so many millions are desperately searching for
                              identity.,

                              Caught up in that effort, we develop a heightened awareness of our
                              own individuality—of the traits that make us unique. Our self-image
                              thus changes. We demand to be seen as, and treated as, individuals,
                              and this occurs at pre-

                              cisely the time when the new production system requires more
                              individualized workers.

                              Beyond helping us to crystallize what is purely personal in us, the new
                              communications media of the Third Wave turn us into producers—or
                              rather prosumers—of our own self-imagery.

                              The German poet and social critic Hans Magnus En-zensberger has
                              noted that in yesterday's mass media the "technical distinction]]></page><page Index="315"><![CDATA[between receivers and transmitters reflects the social division of labor
                              into producers and consumers." Throughout the Second Wave era this
                              meant that professional communicators produced the messages for
                              the audience. The audience remained powerless to respond directly to,
                              or to interact with, the message senders.

                              By Contrast, the most revolutionary feature of the new means of
                              communication is that many of them are interactive—permitting each
                              individual user to make or send images as well as merely to receive
                              them from the outside. Two-way cable, video cassette, cheap copiers
                              and tape recorders, all place the means of communication into the
                              hands of the individual.

                              Looking ahead, one can imagine a stage at which even ordinary
                              television becomes interactive, so that instead of merely watching
                              some Archie Bunker or Mary Tyler Moore of the future, we are actually
                              able to talk to them and influence their behavior in the show. Even
                              now, the Qube cable system makes it technologically possible for
                              viewers of a dramatic show to call on the director to speed up or slow
                              down the action or to choose one story ending over another.

                              The communications revolution gives us each a more complex image
                              of self. It differentiates us further. It speeds the very process by which
                              we "try on" different images of self and, in fact, accelerates our
                              movement through successive images. It makes it possible for us to
                              project our image electronically to the world. And nobody fully
                              understands what all this will do to our personalities. For in no previous
                              civilization have we ever had such powerful tools. We increasingly own
                              the technology of consciousness.

                              The world we are fast entering is so remote from our past experience
                              that all psychological speculations are admittedly shaky. What is
                              absolutely clear, however, is that powerful forces are streaming
                              together to alter social character—to

                              THE PERSONALITY OF THE FUTURE

                              elicit certain traits, to suppress others, and in the process to transform
                              us all.

                              As we move beyond Second Wave civilization we are doing more than
                              shifting from one energy system to another, or from one technological
                              base to the next We are revolutionizing inner space as well. In the light
                              of this, it would be absurd to project the past upon the future—to
                              picture the people of Third Wave civilization in Second Wave terms.

                              If our assumptions are even partially correct, individuals will vary more
                              vividly tomorrow than they do today. More of them are likely to grow up
                              sooner, to show responsibility at an earlier age, to be more adaptable,
                              and to evince greater individuality. They are more likely than their
                              parents to question authority. They will want money and will work for
                              it—but, except under conditions of extreme privation, they will resist
                              working for money alone.]]></page><page Index="316"><![CDATA[Above all, they seem likely to crave balance hi their lives— balance

                              or woman who towers over the people of the past, not a superhuman
                              race of Goethes and Aristotles (or Genghis Khans or Hitlers) but
                              merely, and proudly, one hopes, a race—and a civilization—that
                              deserves to be called human.

                              No hope for such an outcome, no hope for a safe transition to a decent
                              new civilization is possible, however, until we face one final imperative:
                              the need for political transformation. And it is this prospect—both
                              terrifying and exhilarating—that we explore in these final pages. The

                              It is impossible to be simultaneously blasted by a revolution in energy,
                              a revolution in technology, a revolution in family life, a revolution in
                              sexual roles, and a worldwide revolution in communications without
                              also facing—sooner or later—a potentially explosive political
                              revolution.

                              All the political parties of the industrial world, all our congresses,
                              parliaments, and supreme Soviets, our presidencies and prime
                              ministerships, our courts and our regulatory agencies, and our layer
                              upon geological layer of government bureaucracy—in short, all the
                              tools we use to make and enforce collective decisions—are obsolete
                              and about to be transformed. A Third Wave civilization cannot operate
                              with a Second Wave political structure..

                              Just as the revolutionaries who created the industrial age could not
                              govern with the leftover apparatus of feudalism, so today we are faced
                              once more with the need to invent new political tools. This is the
                              political message of the Third Wave.

                              Today, although its gravity is not yet recognized, we are witnessing a
                              profound crisis not of this or that government but of representative
                              democracy itself, in all its forms. In one country after another, the

                              machinery still spins helplessly on its axis, unable to produce anything
                              remotely resembling a coherent energy policy.

                              This policy vacuum is not unique. The United States also has no
                              comprehensive (or comprehensible) urban policy, environmental
                              policy, family policy, technology policy. It does not even have—if we
                              listen to critics abroad—a discernible foreign policy. Nor would the
                              American political system have the capacity to integrate and prioritize
                              such policies even if they did exist. This vacuum reflects so advanced
                              a breakdown in decision-making that President Carter, in a wholly
                              unprecedented speech, was forced to condemn the "paralysis . . .
                              stagnation... and drift" of his own government.

                              This collapse of decision-making is, however, not the monopoly of one
                              party or one president. It has been deepening since the early 1960's,
                              and reflects underlying structural problems that no president—
                              Republican or Democrat—can overcome within the framework of the
                              present system. These political problems have destabilizing effects on
                              the other main social institutions such as the family, the school, and
                              the corporation.

                              Dozens of laws with immediate impact on family life cancel and
                              contradict one another, worsening the family crisis. The educational
                              system was flooded with construction funds at precisely the moment
                              when school-age population began to plummet, thus provoking an orgy
                              of useless school building, followed by a cutoff of funds when they are
                              most desperately needed for other purposes. Corporations,
                              meanwhile, are compelled to operate in a political environment so
                              volatile that they literally cannot tell from one day to-the next what
                              government expects of them.

                              First, Congress demands that General Motors and the other auto
                              manufacturers install catalytic converters on all new cars in the
                              interests of a cleaner environment. Then, after GM spends $300 million
                              on converters and signs a $500-million ten-year contract for the
                              precious metals needed for their manufacture, the government
                              announces that cars with

                              catalytic converters emit 35 times more sulphuric acid than cars
                              without them.

                              At the same time, a runaway regulatory machine generates an
                              increasingly impenetrable mesh of rules—45,000 pages of complex
                              new regulations a year. Twenty-seven different government agencies
                              monitor some 5,600 federal regulations that pertain to the manufacture]]></page><page Index="318"><![CDATA[of steel alone. (Thousands of additional rules apply to the mining,
                              marketing, and transport operations of the steel industry.) A leading
                              pharmaceutical firm, Eli Lilly, spends more time filling out government
                              forms than doing heart-disease and cancer research. A single report
                              from Exxon, the oil company, to the Federal Energy Agency runs
                              445,000 pages—the equivalent of a thousand volumes!

                              This mandarin complexity weighs the economy down, while the jerky,
                              on-again-off-again responses of government decision-makers add to
                              the prevailing sense of anarchy. The political system, erratically
                              zigzagging from day to day, greatly complicates the struggle of our
                              basic social institutions for survival.

                              Nor is this decisional breakdown a purely American phenomenon.
                              Governments in France, Germany, Japan, and Britain—not to mention
                              Italy—exhibit similar symptoms, as do those in the Communist
                              industrial nations. And in Japan, a prime minister declares: "We
                              increasingly hear about the worldwide crisis of democracy. Its problem-
                              solving capability, or the so-called governability of a democracy, is
                              being challenged. In Japan, too, parliamentary democracy is on trial.**

                              The political decision-making machinery in all those countries is
                              increasingly strained, overworked, overloaded, drowned in irrelevant
                              data, and faced with unfamiliar perils. What we are seeing, therefore,
                              are government policy makers unable to make high priority decisions
                              (or making them very badly) while they chase frenziedly about making
                              thousands of lesser, often trivial, ones.

                              Even when important decisions are extruded they usually come too
                              late, and seldom accomplish what they are designed to do. "We've
                              solved every problem with legislation," says one hard-pressed British
                              lawmaker. "We've passed seven acts against inflation. We've
                              eliminated injustice numerous times. We've solved the ecology
                              problem. Every problem has been solved countless times by
                              legislation. But the problems remain. Legislation doesn't work."

                              An American TV announcer, reaching into the past for an analogy, puts
                              it differently: "Right now I feel the nation is a

                              stagecoach with the horses running headlong, and a guy trying to pull
                              in the reins, and they are not responding."

                              This is why so many people—including those in high office—feel so
                              powerless. A leading American senator privately tells me of his deep
                              frustration and the feeling that he cannot accomplish anything useful.
                              He questions the ruin of his family life, the frantic pace of his existence,
                              the long hours, hectic travel, endless conferences, and perpetual
                              pressure. He asks, "Is it worth it?" A British M.P. poses the same
                              question, adding that "the House of Commons is a museum piece—a
                              relic!" A top White House official complains to me that even the
                              President, supposedly the most powerful man in the world, feels]]></page><page Index="319"><![CDATA[impotent. "The President feels as though he is shouting into the
                              telephone—with nobody at the other end."

                              This deepening breakdown of the ability to make timely and competent
                              decisions changes the deepest power relationships in society. Under
                              normal, nonrevolutionary circumstances, the elites in any society use
                              the political system to reinforce their rule and further their ends. Their
                              power is defined by the ability to make certain things happen, or to
                              prevent certain things from happening. This presupposes, however,
                              their ability to predict and control events—it assumes that when they
                              yank on the reins, the horses will stop.

                              Today the elites can no longer predict the outcomes of their own
                              actions. The political systems through which they operate are so
                              antiquated and creaky, so outraced by events, that even when closely
                              "controlled" by the elites for their own benefit, the results often backfire.

                              This does not mean, one hastens to add, that the power lost by the
                              elites has accrued to the rest of society. Power is not transferred: it is
                              increasingly randomized, so that no one knows from moment to
                              moment who is responsible for what, who has real (as distinct from
                              nominal) authority, or how long that authority will last. In this seething
                              semi-anarchy, ordinary people crow bitterly cynical not merely about
                              their own "representatives" but—more ominously—about the very
                              possibility of being represented at all.

                              As a result, the Second Wave "reassurance ritual" of voting begins to
                              lose its power. Year by year, American voting participation decreases.
                              In the 1976 presidential election fully 46 percent of eligible voters
                              stayed home, meaning that a president was elected bv roughly one
                              quarter of the electorate—in reality only about one eighth of the total
                              popula-

                              tion of the country. More recently, pollster Patrick Caddell found that
                              only 12 percent of the electorate still felt that voting matters at all.

                              Similarly, political parties are losing their drawing power. In the period
                              1960-1972 the number of "independents" unaf-filiated with any party in
                              the United States shot up 400 percent, making 1972 the first time in
                              more than a century that the number of independents equaled the
                              membership of one of the major parties.

                              Parallel tendencies are apparent elsewhere, too. The Labour Party,
                              which governed Britain until 1979, has atrophied to the point at which,
                              in a country of 56,000,000 people it is lucky if it can claim 100,000
                              active members. In Japan the Yomiuri Shimbun reports that "voters
                              have little faith in their governments. They feel detached from their
                              leaders." A wave of political disenchantment sweeps Denmark. Asked
                              why, a Danish engineer speaks for many when he says, "Politicians
                              appear useless in stopping the trends."]]></page><page Index="320"><![CDATA[In the Soviet Union, writes the dissident author Victor Nekipelov, the
                              last decade has seen "ten years of deepening chaos, militarization,
                              catastrophic economic disorder, increases hi the cost of living,
                              insufficient basic food products, increases in crime and drunkenness,
                              corruption and thieving, but above all of an uncontrollable drop in
                              prestige of the present leadership in the eyes of the people."

                              In New Zealand, the vacuity of mainstream politics prompted one
                              protester to change his name to Mickey Mouse and enter himself as a
                              candidate. So many others did likewise—adopting names like Alice in
                              Wonderland—that Parliament rushed through a law banning anyone
                              from running for office if he or she had legally changed a name within
                              six months prior to an election.

                              More than anger, citizens are now expressing revulsion and contempt
                              for their political leaders and government officials. They sense that the
                              political system, which should serve as a steering wheel or stabilizer in
                              a change-tossed, runaway society, is itself broken, spinning and
                              flapping out of control.

                              Thus when a team of political scientists investigated Washington, D.C.,
                              recently to find out "who runs this place?" they came up with a simple,
                              crushing answer. Then* report, published by the American Enterprise
                              Institute, was summed up by Professor Anthony King of the University
                              of Essex in Britain: "The short answer . . . would have to be, 'No one.
                              Nobody is in charge here.'"

                              Not just in the United States but in many of the Second Wave countries
                              being battered by the Third Wave of change, there is a spreading
                              power vacuum—a "black hole" in society.

                              PRIVATE ARMIES

                              The dangers implicit in this power vacuum can be gauged by glancing
                              briefly backward at the mid-1970's. Then, as energy and raw material
                              flows faltered in the wake of the OPEC embargo, as inflation and
                              unemployment spurted, as i he dollar plunged and Africa, Asia, and
                              South America began to demand a new economic deal, signs of
                              political pathology flared in one after another of the Second Wave
                              nations.

                              In Britain, celebrated as the home of tolerance and civility, retired
                              generals began to recruit private armies to impose order, and a
                              resurgent fascist movement, the National Front, fielded candidates in
                              some 90 parliamentary constituencies. Fascists and left-wingers came
                              close to fighting a massed battle in the London streets. In Italy the
                              fascists of the left, the Red Brigades, escalated their reign of
                              kneecapping, kidnapping, and assassination. In Poland, the
                              government's attempt to hike food prices to keep up with inflation
                              brought the country to the edge of revolt. In West Germany, wracked
                              by terrorist murders, a jittery establishment rushed through a series of
                              McCarthyite laws to suppress dissent.]]></page><page Index="321"><![CDATA[It is true that these signs of political instability receded as the industrial
                              economies partially (and temporarily) recovered in the late 1970's.
                              Britain's private armies never came into play. The Red Brigades, after
                              killing Aldo Moro, appeared for a time to pull back for regrouping. A
                              new regime took over smoothly in Japan. The Polish government
                              made an uneasy peace with its rebels. In the United States, Jimmy
                              Carter, who won office by running against "the system" (and then

                              disastrous decline in popularity.

                              Nevertheless, these evidences of instability must make us wonder
                              whether existing Second Wave political systems in each of the
                              industrial nations can survive the next round of crises. For the crises of
                              the 1980's and 1990's are likely to be even more severe, disruptive,
                              and dangerous than those just

                              past. Few informed observers believe the worst is over, and ominous
                              scenarios abound.

                              If turning off the oil spigots for a few weeks in Iran could cause
                              violence and chaos on gas lines in the United States, what is likely to
                              happen, not only in the U.S., when the present rulers of Saudi Arabia
                              are kicked off the throne? Is it likely that this tiny clique of ruling
                              families, who control 25 percent of the world's oil reserves, can cling to
                              power indefinitely, while intermittent warfare rages between North and
                              South Yemen nearby, and their own country is destabilized by floods of
                              petrodollars, immigrant workers, and radical Palestinians? Just how
                              wisely will the shell-shocked (and future-shocked) politicians in
                              Washington, London, Paris, Moscow, Tokyo, or Tel Aviv respond to a
                              coup d'etat, a religious upheaval, or a revolutionary uprising in
                              Riyadh—let alone to the sabotage of the oil fields at Ghawar and
                              Abqaiq?

                              How would these same overworked, nervously twitching Second Wave
                              political leaders, East and West, respond if, as Sheikh Yamani
                              predicts, frogmen were to sink a ship or mine the waters of the Strait of
                              Hormuz, thereby blocking half the oil shipments on which the world
                              depends for survival? It is scarcely reassuring to look at a map and
                              note that Iran, barely able to maintain domestic law and order, sits on
                              one bank of that strategically vital, all too narrow channel.

                              What happens, asks another chilling scenario, when Mexico begins in
                              earnest to exploit its oil—and faces a sudden, overpowering influx of
                              petro-pesos? Will its ruling oligarchy have the desire, much less the
                              technical skills, to distribute the bulk of that new wealth to Mexico's
                              malnourished and long-suffering peasantry? And can it do so rapidly
                              enough to prevent today's low-level guerrilla activity there from
                              exploding into a full-scale war on the doorstep of the United States? If
                              such a war were to break out, how would Washington respond? And
                              how would the huge population of Chicanes in the ghettos of Southern
                              California or Texas react? Can we expect even semi-intelligent
                              decisions about crises of such magnitude, given today's disarray in
                              Congress and the White House?]]></page><page Index="322"><![CDATA[Economically, will governments already incapable of managing macro-

                              one look forward to economic stability in the years ahead? Uiven
                              skyrocketing inflation and unemployment, a credit «.-i ash, or some
                              other economic catastrophe, we may yet see pi i vale armies in action.

                              Finally, what happens when, among the myriad religious cults now
                              flowering, some spring up to organize for political purposes? As the
                              major organized religions splinter under the ilc-massifyirig impact of the
                              Third Wave, armies of self-or-«l.lined priests, ministers, preachers, and
                              teachers are likely to appear—some with disciplined, perhaps even
                              paramilitary, political followings.

                              In the United States, it is not hard to imagine some new political party
                              running Billy Graham (or some facsimile) on a crude "law-and-order" or
                              "anti-porn" program with a strong authoritarian streak. Or some as yet
                              unknown Anita Bryant demanding imprisonment for gays or "gay-
                              symps." Such examples provide only a fault, glimmering intimation of
                              the religio-politics that may well lie ahead, even in the most secular of
                              societies. One can imagine all sorts of cult-based political movements
                              headed by Ayatollahs named Smith, Schultz, or Santini.

                              I am not saying these scenarios will necessarily materialize. They
                              could all turn out to be farfetched. But if these don't, we must assume
                              that other dramatic crises will erupt, even more dangerous than those
                              just past. And we must face the fact that our present crop of Second
                              Wave leaders is grotesquely unprepared to cope with them.

                              In fact, because our Second Wave political structures are even more
                              deteriorated today than they were in the 1970's, we must assume that
                              governments will be less competent, less imaginative, and less
                              farsighted in dealing with the crises of the 1980's and 1990's than they
                              were in the decade just past.

                              And this tells us that we must re-examine, from the roots up, one of our
                              most deeply held and dangerous political illusions.

                              The-Messiah Complex is the illusion that we can somehow save
                              ourselves by changing the man (or woman) on top.

                              Watching Second Wave politicians stumble and flail drunk-enly at the
                              problems arising from the emergence of the Third Wave, millions of

                              rived at a single, simple, easy-to-understand explanation of our woes:
                              the "failure of leadership." If only a messiah would appear on the
                              political horizon and put things back together again!

                              This craving for a masterful, macho leader is voiced today by even the
                              most well-meaning of people as their familiar world crumbles, as their
                              environment grows more unpredictable and their hunger for order,
                              structure, and predictability increases. Thus we hear, as Ortega y
                              Gasset put it during the 1930's when Hitler was on the march, "a
                              formidable cry, rising like the howling of innumerable dogs to the stars,
                              asking for someone or something to take command."

                              In the United States, the President is violently condemned for "lack of
                              leadership." In Britain, Margaret Thatcher is elected because she offers
                              at least the illusion of being "the Iron Lady." Even hi the Communist
                              industrial nations, where leadership is anything but timid, the pressure
                              for still "stronger leadership" is intensifying. In the U.S.S.R., a novel
                              appears that baldly glorifies Stalin's ability to draw the "necessary
                              political conclusions." The publication of Victory by Alexander
                              Chakovsky is seen as part of a "restalinization" drive. Little pictures of
                              Stalin sprout on windshields, in homes, hotels, and kiosks. "Stalin on
                              the windshield today," writes Victor Nekipelov, author of Institute of
                              Fools, "is an upsurge from below ... a protest, however paradoxical,
                              against the present disintegration and lack of leadership."

                              As a dangerous decade opens, today's demand for "leadership" strikes
                              at a moment when long-forgotten dark forces are stirring anew in our
                              midst. The New York Times reports that in France, "after more than
                              three decades hi hibernation, small but influential right-wing groups are
                              again seeking the* intellectual limelight, expounding theories on race,
                              biology and political elitism discredited by the defeat of Fascism in
                              World War II."

                              Prating of Aryan racial supremacy, and violently anti-American, they
                              control a major journalistic outlet in Le Figaro's weekly. They argue that
                              the races are born unequal and should be kept that way by social
                              policy. They lace their arguments with references to E. O. Wilson and
                              Arthur Jensen to lend supposedly scientific color to their virulently
                              antidemocratic biases.

                              authoritarianism.

                              Each of these phenomena in turn has its "left" counterpart-—terrorist
                              gangs who mouth the slogans of socialist democracy but are prepared
                              to impose their own brand of totalitarian leadership on society with
                              Kalashnikovs and plastic bombs.

                              In the United States, among other unsettling signs, we see the rebirth
                              of unabashed racism. Since 1978 a resurgent Ku Klux Klan has burned
                              crosses in Atlanta; ringed the city hall of Decatur, Alabama, with armed
                              men; fired shots at Black churches and a synagogue in Jackson,
                              Mississippi; and shown signs of renewed activity in twenty-one states
                              from California to Connecticut. In North Carolina, Klansmen who are
                              also avowed Nazis have killed five left-wing anti-Klan activists.

                              In short, the surge of demand for "stronger leadership" coincides
                              precisely with the recrudescence of highly authoritarian groups who
                              hope to profit from the breakdown of representative government. The
                              tinder and the spark are coming perilously close to one another.

                              This intensifying cry for leadership is based on three misconceptions,
                              the first of which is the myth of authoritarian efficiency. Few ideas are
                              more widely held than the notion that dictators, if nothing else, "make
                              the trains run on time." To-day so many institutions are breaking down
                              and unpredictability is so rife that millions of people would willingly
                              trade some freedom (someone else's, preferably) to make their
                              economic, social, and political trains run on time.

                              Yet strong leadership—and even totalitarianism—has little to do with
                              efficiency. There is not much evidence to suggest that the Soviet Union
                              today is efficiently run, though its lead-ership is assuredly "stronger"
                              and more authoritarian than that in the United States, France, or
                              Sweden. Apart from the military, the secret police, and a few other
                              functions vital to the perpetuation of the regime, the U.S.S.R. is, by all
                              ac-counts—including many in the Soviet press—a sloppy ship indeed.
                              It is a society crippled by waste, irresponsibility, iner-tia, and
                              corruption—in short, by "totalitarian inefficiency."

                              Even Nazi Germany, so marvelously efficient at wiping out Poles,
                              Russians, Jews and other "non-Aryans," was anything

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              but efficient in other ways. Raymond Fletcher, a member of the British
                              Parliament who was educated in Germany and has remained a close
                              observer of German social conditions, reminds us of a forgotten reality:

                              "We think of Nazi Germany as a model of efficiency. In fact, Britain was
                              better organized for war than the Germans. In the Ruhr, the Nazis
                              continued to turn out tanks and armored personnel carriers well after
                              they no longer could find rail transport to take them away. They used
                              their scientists very poorly. Of 16,000 inventions of military significance
                              made during the war, few ever actually got into production because of]]></page><page Index="325"><![CDATA[the prevailing inefficiency. The Nazi intelligence agencies wound up
                              spying on each other, while British intelligence was superb. While the
                              British were organizing everyone to contribute wrought iron fences and
                              saucepans to the war effort, the Germans were still producing luxury
                              goods. While the British drafted women early on, the Germans didn't.
                              Hitler himself was a paragon of indecision. The Third Reich as an
                              example of military or industrial efficiency is a ludicrous myth."

                              It takes more than strong leadership, as we shall see, to make the
                              trains run on time.

                              The second fatal fallacy in the cry for strong leadership is its unspoken
                              assumption that a style of leadership that worked in the past will work
                              in the present or future. We are continually dredging up images from
                              the past when we think about leadership—Roosevelt, Churchill, de
                              Gaulle. Yet different civilizations require vastly different leadership
                              qualities. And what is strong in one may be inept and disastrously
                              weak in another.

                              During First Wave, peasant-based civilization, leadership typically
                              derived from birth, not achievement. A monarch needed certain limited
                              practical skills—the ability to lead men hi combat, the shrewdness to
                              play off his barons against one another, the cleverness to consummate
                              an advantageous marriage. Literacy and broad powers of abstract
                              thought were not among the basic requirements. Moreover, the leader
                              was typically free to exercise sweeping personal authority in the most
                              capricious, even whimsical fashion, unchecked by constitution,
                              legislature, or public opinion. If approval was needed, it was only from
                              a small coterie of nobles, lords, and ministers. The leader able to
                              mobilize this support was "strong."

                              The Second Wave leader, by contrast, dealt hi impersonal

                              and increasingly abstract power. He had many more decisions to make
                              on a far wider variety of matters, from manipulating toe media to
                              managing the macro-economy. His decisions had to be implemented
                              through a chain of organizations and agencies whose complex
                              relationships to one another he understood and orchestrated. He had
                              to be literate and capable of abstract reasoning. Instead of a handful of
                              barons, he had to play off a complex array of elites and sub-elites.
                              Moreover, his authority—even if he were a totalitarian dictator—was at
                              least nominally constrained by constitution, legal precedent, party
                              political requirements, and the force of mass opinion.

                              Given these contrasts, the "strongest" First Wave leader plunged into a
                              Second Wave political framework would have appeared even more
                              weak, confused, erratic, and inept than the "weakest" Second Wave
                              leader.

                              Similarly today, as we race into a new stage of civilization, Roosevelt,
                              Churchill, de Gaulle, Adenauer (or for that matter, Stalin)—the "strong"
                              leaders of industrial societies-would be as out of place and inept as
                              Mad King Ludwig in the White House. The search for seemingly
                              decisive, jut-jawed, sharply opinionated leaders—whether Kennedys,]]></page><page Index="326"><![CDATA[Con-nallys, or Reagans, Chiracs or Thatchers—is an exercise in
                              nostalgia, a search for a father- or mother-figure based on obsolete
                              assumptions. For the "weakness" of today's leaders is less a reflection
                              of personal qualities than it is a consequence of the breakdown of the
                              institutions on which their power depends.

                              In fact, their seeming "weakness" is the exact result of their increased
                              "power." Thus, as the Third Wave continues to transform society,
                              raising it to a much higher level of diversity and complexity, all leaders
                              become dependent on increasing numbers of people for help in
                              making and implementing decisions. The more powerful the tools at a
                              leader's command—supersonic fighters, nuclear weapons, computers,
                              telecommunications—the more, not less, dependent the leader
                              becomes.

                              This is an unbreakable relationship because it reflects the rising
                              complexity on which power today necessarily rests. This is why the
                              American President can sit next to the nuclear push button, which
                              gives him the power to pulverize the planet, and still feel as helpless as
                              though there were "nobody at the other end" of his telephone line.
                              Power and powerless-ness are opposite sides of the same
                              semiconductor chip.

                              these reasons, a wholly new type of leadership. The requisite qualities
                              of Third Wave leaders are not yet entirely clear. We may well find that
                              strength lies not in a leader's assertiveness but precisely in his or her
                              ability to listen to others; not in bulldozer force but in imagination; not in
                              megalomania but in a recognition of the limited nature of leadership in
                              the new world.

                              The leaders of tomorrow may well have to deal with a far more
                              decentralized and participatory society—one even more diverse than
                              today's. They can never again be all things to all people. Indeed, it is
                              unlikely that one human being will ever embody all the traits required.
                              Leadership may well prove to be more temporary, collegia!, and
                              consensual.

                              Jill Tweedie, in a perceptive column in The Guardian, has sensed this
                              shift "It is easy to criticize ... Carter," she wrote. **It is possible he was
                              (is?) a weak and vacillating man. . . . But it is also just possible ... that
                              Jimmy Carter's major sin is his tacit recognition that, as the planet
                              shrinks, the problems ... are so general, so basic and so
                              interdependent that they cannot be solved, as once problems were, by
                              one man or one Government's initiative." In short, she suggests, we
                              are moving painfully toward a new kind of leader not because
                              someone thinks this is a good thing but because the nature of the
                              problems make it necessary. Yesterday's strong man may turn out to
                              be tomorrow's 90-pound weakling.]]></page><page Index="327"><![CDATA[Whether or not this proves to be the case, there is one final, even more
                              damning flaw in the argument that some political messiah is needed to
                              save us from disaster. For this notion presupposes that our basic
                              problem is personnel. And it isn't. Even if we had saints, geniuses, and
                              heroes in charge, we would still be facing the terminal crisis of
                              representative government—the political technology of the Second
                              Wave era.



                              THE WORLD WEB

                              If choosing the "best" leader were all we had to worry about, our
                              problem could be solved within the framework of the existing political
                              system. In fact, however, the problem cuts far deeper. In a nutshell,
                              leaders—even the "best"—are crippled because the institutions they
                              must work through are obsolete.

                              Our political and governmental structures, to begin with,

                              THE POLITICAL MAUSOLEUM

                              405

                              wore designed at a time when the nation-state was still coming into its
                              own. Each government could make more or less independent
                              decisions. Today, as we have seen, this is no longer possible, though
                              We retain the myth of sovereignty. In-ilation has become so
                              transnational a disease that not even Mr. Brezhnev or his successor
                              can prevent the contagion from crossing the border. The Communist
                              industrial countries, even though partially severed from the world
                              economy and rigidly controlled from within, are dependent upon
                              external sources for oil, food, technology, credit, and other necessities.
                              In 1979 the U.S.S.R. was forced to hike many consumer prices.
                              Czechoslovakia doubled the price of fuel oil. Hungary daggered its
                              consumers by boosting the price of electricity 51 percent. Each
                              decision in one country forces problems or calls for responses from the
                              next.

                              France builds a nuclear reprocessing plant at Cap de la Hague (which
                              is closer to London than the British Wind-scale reactor) at a place
                              where radioactive dust or gas, if released, would be wafted toward
                              Britain by the prevailing winds. Mexican oil spills imperil the Texas
                              coastline 500 miles away. And if Saudi Arabia or Libya raises or lowers
                              petroleum production quotas, it has immediate or long-range effects on
                              the ecology of many nations.

                              In this tightly wired web national leaders lost much of their
                              effectiveness no matter what rhetoric they employ or sabers they rattle.
                              Their decisions typically trigger costly, unwanted, frequently dangerous
                              repercussions at both the global and the local level. The scale of
                              government and the distribution of decision-making authority are
                              hopelessly wrong for today's world.

                              This, however, is only one of the reasons why existing political
                              structures are obsolete.]]></page><page Index="328"><![CDATA[THE INTER-WEAVE PROBLEM

                              Our political institutions also reflect an out-of-date organization of
                              knowledge. Every government has ministries or departments devoted
                              to discrete fields such as finance, foreign affairs, defense, agriculture,
                              commerce, post office, or transportation. The United States Congress
                              and other legislative bodies have committees similarly set aside to deal
                              with problems in these fields. What no Second Wave government—
                              even the most centralized and authoritarian—can solve is

                              the inter-weave problem: how to integrate the activities of all these
                              units so they can produce orderly, wholistic programs instead of a
                              mishmash of contradictory and self-canceling

                              effects.

                              If there is one thing we should have learned in the past few decades, it
                              is that all social and political problems are interwoven—that energy, for
                              example, affects economics, which in turn affects health, which in turn
                              affects education, work, family life, and a thousand other things. The
                              attempt to deal with neatly defined problems in isolation from one
                              another— itself a product of the industrial mentality—creates only
                              confusion and disaster. Yet the organizational structure of government
                              mirrors precisely this Second Wave approach to

                              reality.

                              This anachronistic structure leads to interminable jurisdic-

                              tional power struggles, to the externalization of costs (each agency
                              attempting to solve its own problems at the expense of another), and to
                              the generation of adverse side effects. This is why each attempt by
                              government to cure a problem leads to a rash of new problems, often
                              worse than the original one.

                              Governments typically attempt to solve this inter-weave problem
                              through further centralization—by naming a "czar" to cut through the
                              red tape. He makes changes, blind to their destructive side effects—or
                              he piles on so much additional red tape himself that he is soon
                              dethroned. For centralization of power no longer works. Another
                              desperation measure is the creation of innumerable interdepartmental
                              committees to coordinate and review decisions. The result, however, is
                              the construction of yet another set of baffles and filters through which
                              decisions have to pass—and a further complexification of the
                              bureaucratic labyrinth. Our existing governments and political
                              structures are obsolete because they view the world through Second
                              Wave lenses. In turn, this aggravates another problem.

                              THE DECISIONAL SPEEDUP

                              Second Wave governments and parliamentary institutions were
                              designed to make decisions at a leisurely pace, suited to a world in
                              which it might take a week for a message to travel from Boston or New
                              York to Philadelphia. Today if an Ay-atollah seizes hostages in

                              in Washington, Moscow, Paris, or London may have to respond with
                              decisions within minutes. The extreme speed of change catches
                              governments and politicians off guard and contributes to their sense of
                              helplessness and confusion, as the press makes plain. "Only three
                              months ago," writes Advertising Age, "the White House was telling
                              consumers to shop hard before spending then* bucks. Now the
                              government is going all out to prod consumers into spending more
                              freely." Oil experts foresaw the petroleum price explosion, reports Aus-
                              senpolitik, the German foreign policy journal, but *'not the speed of
                              developments." The 1974-1975 recession hit U.S. policy makers with
                              what Fortune magazine terms "stunning speed and severity."

                              Social change, too, is accelerating and putting additional pressure on
                              the political decision-makers. Business Week declares that in the
                              United States, "as long as the migration of industry and population was
                              gradual ... it helped to unify the nation. But within the past five years
                              the process has burst beyond the bounds that can be accommodated
                              by existing political institutions."

                              The politicians' own careers have accelerated, often catching them by
                              surprise. As recently as 1970 Margaret Thatcher forecast that, within
                              her lifetime, no woman would ever be appointed to a high Cabinet post
                              in the British government. In 1979 she herself was the Prime Minister.

                              In the United States, Jimmy Who? shot into the White House hi a
                              matter of months. What's more, although a new president does not
                              take office until the January following the election, Carter became the
                              de facto president immediately. It was Carter, not the out-going Ford,
                              who was battered with questions about the Middle East, the energy
                              crisis, and other issues almost before the ballots were counted. The
                              lame-duck Ford instantaneously became, for practical purposes, a
                              dead •luck, because political time is now too compressed, history
                              moving too fast to permit the traditional delays.

                              Similarly, the "honeymoon" with the press that a new president once
                              enjoyed was truncated in time. Carter, even In-fore inauguration, was
                              blasted for his Cabinet selections nIK! forced to withdraw his choice for
                              head of the CIA. I aier, less than halfway through the four-year term,
                              the in-'Hf'htful political correspondent Richard Reeves was already
                              forecasting a short career for the President because "instant

                              Wave institutions designed for a slower society—cannot churn out
                              intelligent decisions as fast as events require. Either the decisions
                              came too late or indecision takes over.

                              For example, Professor Robert Skidelsky of the School for Advanced
                              International Studies, Johns Hopkins University, writes, "Fiscal policy
                              has been virtually unusable because it takes too long to get
                              appropriate measures through Congress, even when a majority exists."
                              And this was written in 1974, long before the energy stalemate in
                              America entered its sixth interminable year.

                              The acceleration of change has overpowered the decisional capacity of
                              our institutions, making today's political structures obsolete, regardless
                              of party ideology or leadership. These institutions are inadequate not
                              only in terms of scale and structure but in terms of speed as well. And
                              even this is not all.

                              THE COLLAPSE OF CONSENSUS

                              As the Second Wave produced a mass society, the Third Wave de-
                              massifies us, moving the entire social system to a much higher level of
                              diversity and complexity. This revolutionary process, much like the
                              biological differentiation that occurs in evolution, helps explain one of
                              today's most widely noted political phenomena—the collapse of
                              consensus.

                              From one end of the industrial world to the other we hear politicians
                              lamenting the loss of "national purpose," the absence of the good old
                              "Dunkirk spirit," the erosion of "national unity," and the sudden,
                              bewildering proliferation of high-powered splinter groups. The latest
                              buzzword in Washington is "single issue group," referring to the
                              political organizations springing up by the thousands, usually around
                              what each perceives as a single burning issue: abortion, gun control,
                              gay rights, school busing, nuclear power, and so on. So diverse are
                              these interests at both the national and local levels that politicians and
                              officials can no longer keep track of them.

                              Simultaneously, national mass organizations are having trouble
                              holding together. Says a participant at a conference of voluntary
                              organizations, "Local churches are not following the national lead any
                              more." A labor expert reports that instead of a single unified political
                              drive by the AFL-CIO, affiliated unions are increasingly mounting their
                              own campaigns for their own ends.]]></page><page Index="331"><![CDATA[The electorate is not merely breaking into splinters. The splinter groups
                              themselves are increasingly transitory, springing up, dying out, turning
                              over more and more rapidly, and forming a yeasty, hard-to-analyze
                              flux. "In Canada," says one government official, "we now assume the
                              life-span of the new voluntary organizations will be six to eight months.
                              There are more groups and they are more ephemeral." In this way,
                              acceleration and diversity combine to create a totally new kind of body
                              politic.

                              These same developments also sweep into oblivion our notions about
                              political coalitions, alliances, or united fronts. In a Second Wave
                              society a political leader could glue together half a dozen major blocs,
                              as Roosevelt did in 1932, and expect the resulting coalition to remain
                              locked in position for many years. Today it is necessary to plug
                              together hundreds, even thousands, of tiny, short-lived special interest
                              groups, and the coalition itself will prove short-lived as well. It may
                              cleave together just long enough to elect a president, then break apart
                              again the day after election, leaving him without a base of support for
                              his programs.

                              This de-massification of political life, reflecting all the deep trends we
                              have discussed in technology, production, communications, and
                              culture, further devastates the politicians' ability to make vital
                              decisions. Accustomed to juggling a few well-organized and clearly
                              organized constituencies, they suddenly find themselves besieged. On
                              all sides, countless new constituencies, fluidly organized, demand
                              simultaneous attention to real but narrow and unfamiliar needs.

                              cracies through every crack, with every mailbag and messenger, over
                              the transom and under the door. This tremendous pile-up of demands
                              leaves no time for deliberation. Furthermore, because society is
                              changing at an accelerating pace and a decision delayed may be far
                              worse than no decision at all, everyone demands instant response.
                              Congress, as a result, is kept so busy, according to Representative N.
                              Y. Mineta, a California Democrat, that "guys meet each other coming
                              and going. It doesn't allow for a coherent train of thought"

                              Circumstances differ from country to country, but what does not differ
                              is the revolutionary challenge posed by the Third Wave to obsolete
                              Second Wave institutions—too slow to keep up with the pace of
                              change and too undifferentiated to cope with the new levels of social
                              and political diversity. Designed for a much slower and simpler society,
                              our institutions are swamped and out of synch. Nor can this challenge
                              be met by merely tinkering with the rules. For it strikes at that most
                              basic assumption of Second Wave political theory: the concept of
                              representation.]]></page><page Index="332"><![CDATA[Thus the rise of diversity means that, although our political systems are
                              theoretically founded on majority rule, it may be impossible to form a
                              majority even on issues crucial to survival. In turn, this collapse of
                              consensus means that more and more governments are minority
                              governments, based on shifting and uncertain coalitions.

                              The missing majority makes a mockery of standard democratic
                              rhetoric. It forces us to question whether, under the convergence of
                              speed and diversity, any constituency can ever be "represented." In a
                              mass industrial society, when people and their needs were fairly
                              uniform and basic, consensus was an attainable goal. In a de-
                              massified society, we not only lack national purpose, we also lack
                              regional, statewide, or city-wide purpose. The diversity in any
                              congressional district or parliamentary constituency, whether in France
                              or Japan or Sweden, is so great that its "representative" cannot
                              legitimately claim to speak for a consensus. He or she cannot
                              represent the general will for the simple reason that there is none.
                              What, then, happens to the very notion of "representative democracy"?

                              To ask this question is not to attack democracy. (We shall shortly see
                              how the Third Wave opens the way to an enriched and enlarged
                              democracy.) But it makes one fact inescapably plain: not only our
                              Second Wave institutions but the very assumptions on which they were
                              based are obsolete.

                              Built to the wrong scale, unable to deal adequately with transnational
                              problems, unable to deal with interrelated problems, unable to keep up
                              with the accelerative drive, unable to cope with the high levels of
                              diversity, the overloaded, obsolete political technology of the industrial
                              age is breaking up under our very eyes.

                              THE DECISIONAL IMPLOSION

                              Too many decisions, too fast, about too many strange and unfamiliar
                              problems—not some imagined "lack of leadership"—explain the gross
                              incompetence of political and governmental decisions today. Our
                              institutions are reeling from a decisional implosion.

                              Working with out-of-date political technology, our capacity for effective
                              governmental decision-making is deteriorating rapidly. "When all the
                              decisions had to be made in the White House,*' wrote William
                              Shawcross in Harper's magazine, discussing the Nixon-Kissinger
                              Cambodian policy, "there was little time for considering fully any one of
                              them." In fact, the White House is so squeezed for decisions—on
                              everything from air pollution, hospital costs, and nuclear power to the
                              elimination of hazardous toys (!)—-that one presidential adviser
                              confided to me, "We are all suffering from future shock here!"

                              Nor are the executive agencies much better off. Each department is
                              crushed under the mounting decision load. Each is compelled to
                              enforce countless regulations and to generate vast numbers of
                              decisions daily, under tremendous accelerative pressures.]]></page><page Index="333"><![CDATA[Thus, a recent investigation of the U.S. National Endowment for the
                              Arts found that its council spent all of four and i half minutes
                              considering each class of grant applications. "The number of
                              applications . . . have far outstripped the ability of the NBA to make
                              quality decisions," the report declared.

                              Few good studies of this decisional logjam exist. One of the best is
                              Trevor Armbrister's analysis of the 1968 Pueblo incident involving the
                              capture of a U.S. spy ship by the North Koreans and a dangerous
                              showdown between the two countries. According to Armbrister, the
                              Pentagon official who performed the "risk evaluation" on the Pueblo
                              mission, and approved it, had only a few hours to appraise the risks of
                              76

                              different proposed military missions. The official subsequently refused
                              to estimate how much time he had actually spent considering the
                              Pueblo.

                              But, in a revealing quote cited by Armbrister, a Defense Intelligence
                              Agency official explained: "The way it probably worked ... is that he got
                              the book on his desk one morning at nine o'clock with orders to return
                              it by noon. That book is the size of a Sears, Roebuck catalogue. It
                              would be a physical impossibility for him to study each mission hi
                              detail." Nevertheless, under the pressure of time, the risk on the
                              Pueblo mission was termed "minimal." On average, if the DIA agent is
                              correct, each military mission evaluated that morning received less
                              than two and a half minutes' consideration. No wonder things don't
                              work.

                              Pentagon officials, for example, have lost track of $30 billion in foreign
                              weapons orders and do not know whether this reflects colossal errors
                              in accounting, or a failure to bill the purchasers for the full amounts
                              due, or whether the money was dribbled away on other things entirely.
                              This multibillion-dollar bungle, according to a Department of Defense
                              comptroller, has the "lethal potential of a loose cannon rolling around
                              our deck." He confesses, "The sad fact is that we don't really know
                              how big this [confusion] really is. It will probably be five years before
                              we'll be able to sort [it all] out." And if the Pentagon, with its computers
                              and surefire information systems, is becoming too large and complex
                              to manage properly, as may well be the case, what about the
                              government as a whole?

                              The old decision-making institutions increasingly mirror the disarray hi
                              the outside world. Carter adviser Stuart Eizenstat speaks of "the
                              fragmentation of society into interest groups" and the corresponding
                              "fragmentation of congressional authority into subgroups." Faced with
                              this new situation, a president can no longer easily impose his will on
                              Congress.

                              Traditionally, an incumbent president could cut a deal with half a dozen
                              elderly and powerful committee chairmen, and expect them to deliver]]></page><page Index="334"><![CDATA[the votes necessary to approve his legislative program. Today
                              congressional committee chairmen and women can no more deliver

                              including members of Congress—are doing more of their own thinking,
                              and taking orders less submissively. All

                              413

                              this makes it impossible, however, for Congress, as presently
                              structured, to devote sustained attention to any issue or to respond
                              quickly to the nation's needs.

                              Referring to the "frenetic schedule," a report by the Congressional
                              Clearinghouse on the Future summarizes the situation vividly:
                              "Increasing complexity and speed-of-light crises, such as votes in one
                              week on gas deregulation, Rhodesia, the Panama Canal, a new
                              Department of Education, food stamps, AMTRAK authorization, solid
                              waste disposal, and endangered species, are turning Congress, once
                              a center for careful and thoughtful debate . . . into the laughing stock of
                              the nation."

                              Obviously, political processes vary from one industrial country to the
                              next, but similar forces are at work on all of them. "The United States is
                              not the only country that seems confused and stagnant," declares U.S.
                              News & World Report. "Take a look at the Soviet Union. . . . No
                              response to U.S. nuclear-arms-control proposals. Long delays in
                              negotiating trade agreements with both socialist and capitalist nations.
                              Confused treatment of French President Giscard d'Estaing during a
                              state visit. Indecision over the Mideast policy. Contradictory calls for
                              West Europe's Communists to confront and cooperate with home
                              governments. . . . Even in a one-party system it is almost impossible to
                              project firm policies—or re-ipond quickly on complex issues."

                              In London a member of Parliament tells us that central government is
                              "grossly overloaded," and Sir Richard Marsh, a former Cabinet
                              minister, now head of the British Newspaper Publishers Association,
                              declares that "the Parliamentary •Iructure has remained relatively
                              unchanged over the past 250 years and it's just not geared to the sort
                              of managerial decision-making necessary today. . . . The whole thing is
                              to-lully ineffectual," he says, and the "Cabinet is not much I bptter."

                              What about Sweden, with its shaky coalition government hnrely able to
                              resolve the nuclear issue that has torn the country apart for nearly a
                              decade? Or Italy, with its terrorism Km I recurrent political crises—

                              What we confront is a new and menacing truth. The po-||lllcal shudders

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              A political system must not only be able to make and enforce
                              decisions; it must operate on the right scale, it must be able to
                              integrate disparate policies, it must be able to make decisions at the
                              right speed, and it must both reflect and respond to the diversity of
                              society. If it fails on any of these points it courts disaster. Our problems
                              are no longer a matter of "left-wing" or "right-wing," "strong leadership"
                              or "weak." The decision system itself has become a menace.

                              The truly astonishing fact today is that our governments continue to
                              function at all. No corporation president would try to run a large
                              company with a table of organization first sketched by the quill pen of
                              some eighteenth-century ancestor whose sole managerial experience
                              consisted of running a farm. No sane pilot would attempt to fly a
                              supersonic jet with the antique navigation and control instruments
                              available to Bleriot or Lindbergh. Yet this is approximately what we are
                              trying to do politically.

                              The rapid obsolescence of our Second Wave political systems, in a
                              world bristling with nuclear weapons and poised delicately on the edge
                              of economic or ecological collapse, creates an extreme threat for the
                              entire society—not merely for the "outs" but for the "ins," not merely for
                              the poor but for the rich, and for the non-industrial parts of the world as
                              well. For the immediate danger to all of us lies not so much in the
                              calculated uses of power by those who have it, as in the uncalculated
                              side effects of decisions ground out by politico-bureaucratic decision
                              machines so dangerously anachronistic that even the best of intentions
                              can eventuate in murderous outcomes.

                              Our so-called "contemporary" political systems are copied from models
                              invented before the advent of the factory system—before canned food,
                              refrigeration, gaslight, or photography, before the Bessemer furnace or
                              the introduction of the typewriter, before the invention of the telephone,
                              before Or-ville and Wilbur Wright took whig, before the automobile and
                              the airplane shrunk distance, before radio and television began
                              working their alchemy on our minds, before Auschwitz industrialized
                              death, before nerve gas and nuclear missiles, before computers,
                              copying machines, birth control pills, transistors, and lasers. They were
                              designed in an intellectual world that is almost unimaginable—a world
                              that was pre-Marx, pre-Darwin, pre-Freud and pre-Einstein.

                              This, then, is the single most important political issue fac-

                              institutions.

                              As we are jolted by crisis after crisis, aspiring Hitlers and Siulins will
                              crawl from the wreckage and tell us that the time lias come to solve our
                              problems by throwing away not only our obsolete institutional hulks but
                              our freedom as well. As we race into the Third Wave era, those of us]]></page><page Index="336"><![CDATA[who want to ex-p.md human freedom will not be able to do so by
                              simply defending our existing institutions. We shall—like America's
                              founding parents two centuries ago—have to invent new ones.

                              CENTURY

                              DEMOCRACY

                              To the Founding Parents:

                              You are the revolutionists dead. You are the men and women, the
                              farmers, merchants, artisans, lawyers, printers, pamphleteers,
                              shopkeepers, and soldiers who together created a new nation on the
                              distant shores of America. You include the fifty-five who came together
                              in 1787 to hammer out, during a broiling summer in Philadelphia, that
                              astonishing document called the Constitution of the United States. You
                              are the inventors of a future that became my present.

                              That piece of paper, with the Bill of Rights added in 1791, is clearly one
                              of the stunning achievements of human history. I, like so many others,
                              am continually forced to ask myself how you managed—how you were
                              able, in the midst of bitter social and economic turmoil, under the most
                              immediate pressures—to muster so much awareness of the emerging
                              future. Listening to the distant sounds of tomorrow, you sensed that a
                              civilization was dying and a new one was being born.

                              I conclude you were driven to it—were compelled, carried along by the
                              tidal force of events, fearing the collapse of an ineffectual government
                              paralyzed by inappropriate principles and obsolete structures.

                              Seldom has so majestic a piece of work been done by men of such
                              sharply divergent temperaments—brilliant, antagonistic, and egotistic
                              men—men passionately committed to diverse regional and economic
                              interests, yet so upset and outraged by the terrible "inefficiencies" of an
                              existing government as to draw together and propose a radically new
                              one based on startling principles. 416

                              I'.ven now these principles move me, as they have moved «mmtless
                              millions around the planet. I confess it difficult for iIK to read certain
                              passages of Jefferson or Paine, for exam-HO, without being brought to
                              the edge of tears by their IM .inly and meaning.

                              I want to thank you, the revolutionary dead, for having inmle possible
                              for me a half-century of life as an American i iir/.en under a
                              government of laws, not men, and particularly for that precious Bill of
                              Rights, which has made it possible for me to think, to express
                              unpopular views, however foolish ui mistaken at times—indeed, to
                              write what follows without fi-iir of suppression.]]></page><page Index="337"><![CDATA[For what I now must write can all too easily be misunder-ilood by my
                              contemporaries. Some will no doubt regard it as Ni-ditious. Yet it is a
                              painful truth I believe you would have quickly grasped. For the system
                              of government you fash-hmcd, including the very principles on which
                              you based it, is Increasingly obsolete, and hence increasingly, if
                              inadvertently, oppressive and dangerous to our welfare. It must be
                              radically changed and a new system of government invented—a
                              democracy for the twenty-first century.

                              You knew, better than we today, that no government, no political
                              system, no constitution, no charter or state is permanent, nor can the
                              decisions of the past bind the future forever. Nor can a government
                              designed for one civilization tope adequately with the next.

                              You would have understood, therefore, why even the Con-Niilution of
                              the United States needs to be reconsidered, and nliered—not to cut
                              the federal budget or to embody this or i hat narrow principle, but to
                              expand its Bill of Rights, taking necount of threats to freedom
                              unimagined in the past, and to create a whole new structure of
                              government capable of making intelligent, democratic decisions
                              necessary for our survival In a new world.

                              I come with no easy blueprint for tomorrow's constitution. I mistrust
                              those who think tfiey already have the answers when we are still trying
                              to formulate the questions. But the time has come for us to imagine
                              completely novel alternatives, to discuss, dissent, debate, and design,
                              from the ground up, the democratic architecture of tomorrow.

                              Not in a spirit of anger or dogmatism, not hi a sudden impulsive spasm,
                              but through the widest consultation and peaceful public participation,
                              we need to join together to reconstitute America.

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              You would have understood this need. For it was one of your
                              generation—Jefferson—who, in mature reflection, declared: "Some
                              men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem
                              them like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched. They
                              ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human,
                              and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment.... I am certainly
                              not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and
                              constitutions . . / But I also know that laws and institutions must go
                              hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. . . .As new
                              discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions
                              change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance
                              also, and keep pace with the times."

                              For this wisdom, above all, I thank Mr. Jefferson, who helped create
                              the system that served us so well for so long, and that now must, hi its
                              turn, die and be replaced.

                              who, given the opportunity, would express similar sentiments. For the
                              obsolescence of many of today's governments is not some secret I
                              alone have discovered. Nor is it a disease of America alone.

                              The fact is that building a new civilization on the wreckage of the old
                              involves the design of new, more appropriate political structures in
                              many nations at once. This is a painful yet necessary project that is
                              mind-staggering in scope and will no doubt take decades to complete.

                              In all likelihood it will require a protracted battle to radically overhaul—
                              or even scrap—the United States Congress, the Central Committees
                              and Politburos of the Communist industrial states, the House of
                              Commons and the House of Lords, the French Chamber of Deputies,
                              the Bundestag, the Diet, the giant ministries and entrenched civil
                              services of many nations, the constitutions and court systems—in
                              short, much of the unwieldy and increasingly unworkable apparatus of
                              supposedly representative governments.

                              Nor will this wave of political struggle stop at the national level. Over
                              the months and decades ahead, the entire "global law machine"—from
                              the United Nations at one end to the local city or town council at the
                              other—will eventually face a mounting, ultimately irresistible, demand
                              for restructuring

                              controlled by this or that class or group, but because they are
                              increasingly unworkable—no longer fitted to the needs a radically

                              Expressing the beliefs of his revolutionary generation, n was Jefferson,
                              once again, who asserted that governments must behave with
                              "absolute acquiescence in the decisions ol the majority." The United

                              THE THIRD WAVE

                              says political scientist Walter Dean Burnham of the Massachusetts
                              Institute of Technology, "I don't see the basis for any positive majority
                              on anything today."

                              Because their legitimacy depended on it, Second Wave elites always
                              claimed to speak on behalf of the majority. The United States
                              government was "of ... by ... and for the people." The Soviet
                              Communist Party spoke for the "working class." Mr. Nixon claimed to
                              represent America's "Silent Majority." And in the United States today,
                              neo-Conservative intellectuals attack the demands of newly vocal
                              minorities like Blacks, feminists, or Chicanes, and claim to speak for
                              the interests of the great, solid, moderate, middle-of-the-road majority.

                              Headquartered in the great universities of the Northeast and think
                              tanks in Washington, seldom setting foot in places like Marietta, Ohio,
                              or Salina, Kansas, academic neo-Conser-vatives apparently regard
                              "Middle America" as a great, unwashed, uniform "mass" of more or
                              less ignorant, anti-intellectual blue-collar hardhats and white-collar
                              suburbanites. Yet these groups are far less uniform or monochromatic
                              than they appear to intellectuals and politicians at a distance.
                              Consensus is just as hard to find in Middle America as elsewhere—at
                              best it is flickering, intermittent, and limited to a very few issues. The
                              neo-Conservatives may well be cloaking their anti-minority policies in
                              the mantle of a mythical, rather than real, majority.

                              Indeed, the very same is true at the other end of the political spectrum.
                              In many Western European countries, socialist and communist parties
                              claim to speak for the "working J masses." Yet the farther we move
                              beyond industrial mass society, the less tenable the Marxist
                              assumptions. For both masses and classes lose much of their
                              significance in the emerging Third Wave civilization.]]></page><page Index="340"><![CDATA[In place of a highly stratified society, in which a few major blocs ally
                              themselves to form a majority, we have a configur- ' ative society—one
                              in which thousands of minorities, many of | them temporary, swirl and
                              form highly novel, transient patterns, seldom coalescing into a 51
                              percent consensus on major; issues. The advance of Third Wave
                              civilization thus weakens the very legitimacy of many existing
                              governments.

                              The Third Wave also challenges all of our conventional assumptions
                              about the relationship of majority rule to social \ justice. Here too, as in
                              so many other matters, we are watching a startling historic flip-flop.
                              Throughout the era of;

                              Second Wave civilization the fight for majority rule was humane and
                              liberating. In still-industrializing countries, like Nouth Africa today, it
                              remains so. In Second Wave societies, majority rule almost always
                              meant a fairer break for the poor. For the poor were the majority.

                              Today, however, in countries shaken by the Third Wave, precisely the
                              opposite is often the case. The truly poor no longer necessarily have
                              numbers on their side. In a good many countries they—like everyone
                              else—have become a minority. And barring economic holocaust, they
                              will remain so.

                              Not only is majority rule, therefore, no longer adequate as it
                              legitimating principle, it is no longer necessarily humanizing or
                              democratic in societies moving into the Third Wave.

                              Second Wave ideologues routinely lament the breakup of mass
                              society. Rather than seeing in this enriched diversity an opportunity for
                              human development, they attack it as "fragmentation" and
                              "Balkanization" and attribute it to the moused "selfishness" of
                              minorities. This trivial explanation nubstitutes effect for cause. For the
                              rising activism of minorities IN not the result of a sudden onset of
                              selfishness; it is, among olher things, a reflection of the needs of a new
                              system of production which requires for its very existence a far more
                              varied, colorful, open, and diverse society than any we have ever
                              known.

                              The implications of this fact are enormous. It means, for example, that
                              when the Russians try to suppress the new diversity, or cork up the
                              political pluralism that comes with it, they actually (to use their own
                              jargon) "fetter the means of production"—they slow down the economic
                              and technological transformation of society. And we hi the noncommu-
                              nist world face the same choice: we can either resist the lhrust toward
                              diversity, in a futile last-ditch effort to save our* Second Wave political
                              institutions, or we can acknowledge diversity and change those
                              institutions accordingly.

                              The former strategy can only be implemented by totali-tnrian means

                              able. But if one hundred men all desperately want the same brass ring,
                              they may be forced to fight for it. On the other hand, if each of the
                              hundred has a different objective, it is for more rewarding for them to
                              trade, cooperate, and form symbiotic relationships. Given appropriate
                              social arrangements, diversity can make for a secure and stable
                              civilization.

                              It is the lack of appropriate political institutions today that unnecessarily
                              sharpens conflict between minorities to the knife-edge of violence. It is
                              the lack of such institutions that makes minorities intransigent. It is the
                              absence of such institutions that makes the majority harder and harder
                              to find.

                              The answer to these problems is not to stifle dissent or to charge
                              minorities with selfishness (as though the elites and their experts are
                              not similarly self-interested). The answer lies in imaginative new
                              arrangements for accommodating and le-gitimating diversity—new
                              institutions that are sensitive to the rapidly shifting needs of changing
                              and multiplying minorities.

                              The rise of a de-massified civilization brings to the surface deep,
                              unsettling questions about the future of majority rule and the entire
                              mechanistic system of voting to express prefer-ences. Some day,
                              future historians may look back on voting, and the search for majorities
                              as an archaic ritual engaged in by communicational primitives. Today,
                              however, in a dangerous world, we cannot afford to delegate total
                              power to anyone, we cannot surrender even the weak popular
                              influence that exists under majoritarian systems, and we cannot allow
                              tiny minorities to make vast decisions that tyrannize all other minorities.

                              This is why we must drastically revise the crude Second Wave
                              methods by which we pursue the elusive majority. We need new
                              approaches designed for a democracy of minori-ties—methods whose
                              purpose is to reveal differences rather than to paper them over with

                              provided an important source of feedback for the ruling elites. When

                              pain, the elites could, at a minimum, shift parties, alter policies, or
                              make s0nie other accommodation.

                              Even m yesterday's iflass society, however, the 51 percent principle
                              was a decidedly blunt, purely quantitative instrument. Voting to
                              determine the majority tells us nothing about the quality of people's
                              views. It can tell us how many people, at a given moment, want X, but
                              not how badly they want it. Above all, it tells us oothing about what
                              they would be willing to trade off for X—crucial information in a society
                              made up of many minorities.

                              Nor does it signal us when a minority feels so threatened, or attaches
                              such life-and-death significance to a single issue, that its views should
                              perhaps receive more than ordinary weight.

                              In a mass society these well-known weaknesses of majority rule were
                              tolerated because, among other things, most minorities lacked
                              strategic power to disrupt the system. In today's finely wired society, in
                              tvhich all of us are members of minority groups, that is no longer true.

                              For a de-massified Third Wave society the feedback systems of the
                              industrial p^st are entirely too crude. Thus we will have to use voting,
                              and the polls, in a radically new way.

                              Instead of seeking simpleminded yes-or-no votes, we need to identify
                              potential tradeoffs with questions like: "If I give up my position on
                              abortion* will you give up yours on defense spending or nucleaf
                              power?" or "If I agree to a small additional tax on my personal income
                              next year, to be earmarked for your project, what will you offer in
                              return?"

                              In the world we are racing into, with its rich communications
                              technologies, there are many ways for people to register such views
                              without ever setting foot in a polling booth. And there are also ways, as
                              v^e shall see in a moment, to feed these into the political decision-
                              making process.

                              We may also want to de-rig our voting laws to eliminate anti-minority
                              biases. There are many ways to do this. One quite conventional
                              method would be to adopt some variant of cumulative voting, as used
                              by many corporations today to protect the rights of minofity
                              stockholders. Such methods allow voters to register not tf»ly their
                              preferences but the intensity and rank order of their choices.

                              We shall almost certainly have to discard our obsolete party structures,

                              We may need to appoint "diplomats" or "ambassadors" whose job is
                              not to mediate between countries but between minorities within each
                              country. We may have to create quasi-political institutions to help
                              minorities—whether professional, ethnic, sexual, regional, recreational,
                              or religious—to form and break alliances more quickly and easily.

                              We may, for instance, need to provide arenas in which different
                              minorities, on a rotating, perhaps even random basis, are brought
                              together to trade problems, negotiate deals, and resolve disputes. If
                              doctors, motorcyclists, computer programmers, Seventh-Day
                              Adventists and Gray Panthers were brought together, with assistance
                              from facilitators trained in issue clarification, priority setting, and
                              dispute resolution, sur-' prising and constructive alliances might be
                              formed.

                              At a minimum, differences could be exposed and the basis for political
                              barter explored. Such measures will not (and should not) eliminate all
                              conflict. But they can elevate social and political strife to a more
                              intelligent, potentially construe-tive level—especially if they are linked
                              to long-range goal setting.

                              Today the very complexity of issues inherently provides a greater
                              variety of bargainable points. Yet the political system is not structured
                              to take advantage of this fact Potential alliances and trades go
                              unnoticed—thus unnecessarily raising; tensions between groups while
                              further straining and overloading existing political institutions.

                              Finally, we may well need to empower minorities to regulate more of
                              their own affairs, and encourage them to formulate long-range goals.
                              We might, for example, help the people in a specific neighborhood, in a
                              well-defined subculture, or in an ethnic group, to set up their own youth
                              courts under the supervision of the state, disciplining their own young
                              people rather than relying on the state to do so. Such institutions would
                              build community and identity, and contribute to law and order, while
                              relieving the overburdened government institutions of unnecessary
                              work.

                              We may, however, find it necessary to go far beyond such reformist
                              measures. To strengthen minority representation in a political system
                              designed for a de-massified society, we may even eventually have to
                              elect at least some of our officials in the oldest way of all: by drawing
                              lots. Thus some people

                              today.

                              Theodore Becker, professor of law and political science at the
                              University of Hawaii, asks, "Why is it that important life and death]]></page><page Index="344"><![CDATA[decisions can be made by the people serving on. . . * juries, but

                              Charging that the existing political arrangements systematically
                              shortchange minorities, Becker, a constitutional authority, reminds us
                              that while nonwhites make up some 20 percent of the American
                              population, they held (in 1976) only 4 percent of the seats in the House
                              of Representatives and only 1 percent in the Senate. Women, who
                              comprise over 50 percent of the population, held only 4 percent of the
                              seats in the House—and none in the Senate. Poor people, young
                              people, smart but inarticulate people, and many other groups are
                              similarly disadvantaged. Nor is this merely true of the United States. In
                              the Bundestag only 7 percent of the seats are held by women, and
                              similar biases are evident in many other governments as well. Such
                              gross distortions cannot but blunt the sensitivity of the system to the
                              needs of underrep-resented groups.

                              Says Becker, "Between 50 and 60 percent of the American Congress
                              should be chosen at random from the American people in much the
                              same way they are pressed into "military service through drafts when
                              they are deemed necessary." Startling as the suggestion is at first
                              blush, it forces us to consider seriously whether randomly chosen
                              representatives would (or could) do worse than those chosen through
                              today's methods.

                              If we let ourselves imagine freely for the moment, we can come up with
                              many other surprising alternatives. Indeed, we now have the
                              techniques necessary to choose far more truly representative samples
                              than the jury system or the draft, with their preferential exclusions, ever
                              did. We can build an even more innovative congress or parliament of
                              the future—and do it, paradoxically, with less disturbance of tradition.

                              ,We don't have to pick a group of people by lot and literally trundle
                              them off, like so many Mr. Smiths, to Washington, London, Bonn,
                              Paris, or Moscow. We could, if we chose, keep our elected
                              representatives, allowing them, however, to cast only 50 percent of the
                              votes on any issue, while turning

                              methods, it has become simple not only to select a random sample of
                              the public but to keep updating that sample from day to day and to
                              provide it with up-to-the-minute information on the issues at hand.

                              institutions and constitutions are obsolete and we begin searching for
                              alternatives, all sorts of breathtaking political options, never before
                              possible, suddenly open up to us. If we are to govern societies racing
                              into the twenty-first century, we ought to at least consider the
                              technologies and conceptual tools made available to us by the

                              at it together, we can no doubt come up with far better ideas, easier to
                              implement, less drastic in design. What is important is the general path
                              we choose to travel. We can fight a losing battle to suppress or
                              submerge today's burgeoning minorities, or we can reconstitute our
                              political systems to

                              accommodate the new diversity. We can continue to use the crude,
                              bludgeonlike tools of Second Wave political systems, or we can design
                              sensitive new tools for a minority-based democracy of tomorrow.

                              As the Third Wave de-massifies the old Second Wave mass society,
                              its pressures, I believe, will dictate that choice. For if politics were "pre-
                              majoritarian" during the First Wave, and "majoritarian" during the
                              Second, they are likely to be "mini-majoritarian" tomorrow—a fusion of
                              majority rule with minority power.

                              SEMI-DIRECT DEMOCRACY

                              The second building-block of tomorrow's political systems must be the
                              principle of "semi-direct democracy"—a shift from depending on
                              representatives to representing ourselves. The mixture of the two is

                              The collapse of consensus, as we have already seen, subverts the
                              very concept of representation. Without agreement among the voters]]></page><page Index="346"><![CDATA[back home, whom does the representative really "represent"? At the
                              same time, legislators have come to rely increasingly on staff support
                              and on outside experts for advice in shaping the laws. British M.P.s are
                              notoriously weak vis-d-vis the Whitehall bureaucracy because they
                              lack adequate staff support, thus shifting more power away from
                              Parliament to the unelected civil service.

                              The United States Congress, in an effort to counterbalance the
                              influence of the executive bureaucracy, has created its own
                              bureaucracy—a Congressional Budget Office, an Office of Technology
                              Assessment, and other necessary agencies and appendages. Thus
                              the congressional staff has grown from 10,700 to 18,400 in the past
                              decade. But this has merely transferred the problem from extramural to
                              intramural. Our elected representatives know less and less about the
                              myriad measures on which they must decide, and are compelled to
                              rely more and more on the judgment of others. The representative no
                              longer even represents him- or herself.

                              More basically, parliaments, congresses, or assemblies were places in
                              which, theoretically, the claims of rival minorities could be reconciled.
                              Their "representatives" could make trade-offs for them. With today's
                              antiquated, blunt-edged political tools, no legislator can even keep
                              track of the many grouplets he or she nominally represents, let alone

                              trade effectively for them. And the more overloaded the American
                              Congress or the German Bundestag or the Norwegian Storting
                              becomes, the worse this situation grows.

                              This helps explain why single-issue political pressure groups become
                              intransigent. Seeing limited opportunity for sophisticated trading or
                              reconciliation through Congress or the legislatures, their demands on
                              the system become non-negotiable. The theory of representative
                              government as the ultimate broker collapses too.

                              The breakdown of bargaining, the decision crunch, the worsening
                              paralysis of representative institutions mean, over the long term, that
                              many of the decisions now made by small numbers of pseudo-
                              representatives may have to be shifted back gradually to the electorate
                              itself. If our elected brokers can't make deals for us, we shall have to
                              do it ourselves. If the laws they make are increasingly remote from or
                              unresponsive to our needs, we shall have to make our own. For this,
                              however, we shall need new institutions and new technologies as well.

                              The Second Wave revolutionaries who invented today's basic
                              represento-kit institutions were well aware of the possibilities of direct
                              as against representative democracy. There were traces of direct, do-
                              it-yourself democracy in the French revolutionary constitution of 1793.
                              American revolutionists knew all about New England town halls and
                              small-scale organic consensus formation. In Europe later on, Marx and
                              his followers frequently invoked the Paris Commune as a model of
                              citizen participation in the making and execution of the laws. But the]]></page><page Index="347"><![CDATA[shortcomings and limitations of direct democracy were also well-
                              known—and, at that time, more persuasive.

                              "In The Federalist two objections to such an innovation were raised,"
                              write McCauley, Rood, and Johnson, authors of a proposal for a
                              National Plebiscite in the United States. "First, direct democracy
                              allowed for no check or delay on temporary and emotional public
                              reactions. And second, the communications of that day could not
                              handle the mechanics."

                              These are legitimate problems. How would a frustrated and inflamed
                              American public in the mid-1960's, for example, have voted on whether
                              or not to drop a nuclear bomb on Hanoi? Or a West German public,
                              furious at the Baader-Meinhof terrorists, on a proposal to set up camps
                              for "sympathizers"? What if Canadians had held a plebiscite over

                              Quebec the week after Rene Levesque took power? Elected
                              representatives are presumed to be less emotional and more
                              deliberative than the public.

                              The problem of overemotional public response, however, can be
                              overcome in various ways, such as requiring a cooling-off period or
                              second vote before implementation of major decisions taken via
                              referendum or other forms of direct democracy.

                              One imaginative approach is suggested by an actual program carried
                              out by the Swedes in the mid-1970's when the government called upon
                              the public to participate in the formulation of a national energy policy.
                              Recognizing that most citizens lacked adequate technical knowledge
                              of the various energy options, from solar or nuclear or geothermal, the
                              government created a ten-hour course on energy and invited any
                              Swede who took it, or an equivalent course, to make formal
                              recommendations to the government.

                              Simultaneously, trade unions, adult education centers, and parties
                              from one end of the political spectrum to the other all created their own
                              ten-hour courses. It was hoped that as many as 10,000 Swedes would
                              participate. To everyone's surprise, some 70,000 to 80,000 flocked to
                              discussions in homes and community facilities—the equivalent (on the
                              American scale) of some 2,000,000 citizens trying to think together
                              about a national problem. Similar systems could easily be employed to
                              cancel out the objections to "overemotionalism" in referenda or other
                              forms of direct democracy.

                              The other objection can also be met. For the old communication
                              limitations no longer stand in the way of expanded direct democracy.
                              Spectacular advances in communications technology open, for the first
                              time, a mind-boggling array of possibilities for direct citizen
                              participation in political Decision-making.

                              Not long ago, I had the pleasure of keynoting an historic event—the
                              world's first "electronic town hall"—over the Qube cable TV system in
                              Columbus, Ohio. Using this interactive communications system,
                              residents of a small Columbus suburb actually took part via electronics
                              in a political meeting of their local planning commission. By pushing a
                              button in their living rooms they were able to vote instantly on]]></page><page Index="348"><![CDATA[proposals relating to such practical issues as local zoning, housing
                              codes, and proposed highway construction. They were able not only to
                              vote yes or no but to participate in the discussion and speak up on the
                              air. They were even able, by

                              push button, to tell the chairperson when to move on to the next point
                              on the agenda.

                              This is only the first, most primitive indication of tomorrow's potential
                              for direct democracy. Using advanced computers, satellites,
                              telephones, cable, polling techniques, and other tools, an educated
                              citizenry can, for the first time in history, begin making many of its own
                              political decisions.

                              The issue is not either/or. It is not a question of direct democracy
                              versus indirect, representation by self versus representation by others.

                              For both systems have advantages, and there are highly creative, as
                              yet underutilized, ways to combine direct citizen participation with
                              "representation" into a new system of semi-direct democracy.

                              We might, for example, decide to hold a referendum on a controversial
                              issue like nuclear development, as California and Austria have already
                              done. Instead of turning the ultimate decision over directly to the
                              voters, however, we might still want a representative body—Congress
                              for example—to debate and ultimately decide the issue.

                              Thus if the public voted pro-nuclear, a certain predesig-nated "bundle"
                              of votes could be delivered to the pro-nuclear advocates in Congress.
                              They might, on the strength of the public response, be given an
                              automatic "edge" of 10 percent or 25 percent in Congress itself,
                              depending on the strength of the pro vote in the plebescite. In this way,
                              there is no purely automatic implementation of the citizens' wishes, but
                              these wishes do carry some specific weight. This is a variation of the
                              National Plebescite proposal mentioned above.

                              Many other imaginative arrangements can be invented to combine
                              direct and indirect democracy. Right now members of Congress and
                              most other parliaments or legislatures set up their own committees.
                              There is no way for citizens to force lawmakers to create a committee
                              to deal with some neglected or highly controversial issue. But why
                              couldn't voters be empowered directly, through petition, to compel a
                              legislative body to set up committees on topics the public—not the
                              lawmakers—deems important?

                              I hammer away at these "blue-sky" proposals not because I
                              unhesitatingly favor them but merely to underscore the more general
                              point: There are powerful ways to open and democratize a system that
                              is now near breakdown and in which few, if any, feel adequately
                              represented. But we must begin thinking outside the worn grooves of
                              the past 300 years. We

                              can no longer solve our problems with the ideologies, the models, or
                              the left-over structures of the Second Wave past.

                              Fraught with uncertain implications, such novel proposals warrant
                              careful local experimentation before we apply them on a broad scale.
                              But however we may feel about this or that suggestion, the old
                              objections to direct democracy are growing weaker at precisely the
                              time that the objections to representative democracy are growing
                              stronger. Dangerous or even bizarre as it may seem to some, semi-
                              direct democracy is a moderate principle that can help us design
                              workable new institutions for the future.

                              DECISION DIVISION

                              Opening the system to more minority power and allowing citizens to
                              play a more direct role in their own governance are both necessary,
                              but carry us only part of the way. The third vital principle for the politics
                              of tomorrow is aimed at breaking up the decisional logjam and putting
                              decisions where they belong. This, not simply reshuffling leaders, is
                              the antidote to political paralysis. I call it "decision division."

                              Some problems cannot be solved on a local level. Others cannot be
                              solved on a national level. Some require action at many levels
                              simultaneously. Moreover, the appropriate place to solve a problem
                              doesn't stay put. It changes over time.

                              To cure today's decision logjam resulting from institutional overload,
                              we need to divide up the decisions and reallocate them—sharing them
                              more widely and switching the site of decision-making as the problems
                              themselves require.

                              Today's political arrangements violate this principle wildly. The
                              problems have shifted, but the decisional power hasn't. Thus, too many
                              decisions are still concentrated, and the institutional architecture is
                              most elaborate at the national level. By contrast, not enough decisions
                              are being made at the transnational level, and the structures needed
                              there are radically underdeveloped. In addition, too few decisions are
                              left for the subnational level—regions, states, provinces, and localities,
                              or non-geographical social groupings.

                              Many of the problems that national governments are grappling with
                              are, as we saw earlier, simply beyond their grasp—too big for any
                              individual government. We desperately need, therefore, to invent
                              imaginative "ew institutions at the transnational level to which many
                              decisions can be trans-

                              permit, indeed encourage, their manufacturers to bribe foreign
                              customers. Similarly, multinational companies pursuing responsible
                              environmental policies will continue to face unfair competition from
                              firms that do not, so long as there is no adequate infrastructure at the
                              transnational level.

                              We need transnational food stockpiles and "hot spot" disaster-relief
                              organizations. We need new global agencies to provide early warnings
                              of impending crop failures, to level out swings in the price of key
                              resources, and to control the wildfire spread of the arms trade. We
                              need consortia and teams of nongovernmental organizations to attack
                              various global problems.

                              We need far better agencies to regulate out-of-control currencies. We
                              shall need alternatives to—or complete transformations of—the IMF,
                              the World Bank, COMECON, NATO, and other such institutions. We
                              shall have to invent new agencies to spread the advantages and limit
                              the side effects of technology. We must speed the construction of
                              strong transnational agencies for governing outer space and the
                              oceans. We shall have to overhaul the ossified, bureaucratic United
                              Nations from the ground floor up.

                              At the transnational level, we are as politically primitive and
                              underdeveloped today as we were at the national level when the
                              industrial revolution began 300 years ago. By transferring some
                              decisions "up" from the nation-state, we not only make it possible to
                              act effectively at the level where many of our most explosive problems
                              lie, but simultaneously reduce the decision burden at the overloaded
                              center—the nation-state. Decision division is essential.

                              But moving decisions up the scale is only half the task. It is also clearly
                              necessary to move a vast amount of decision-making downward from
                              the center.

                              Again the issue is not "either/or" in character. It is not decentralization
                              versus centralization in some absolute sense. The issue is rational
                              reallocation of decision-making in a system that has overstressed
                              centralization to the point at which

                              new information flows are swamping the central decision-makers.

                              Political decentralization is no guarantee of democracy— quite vicious
                              localist tyrannies are possible. Local politics are frequently even more
                              corrupt than national politics. Moreover, much that passes for
                              decentralization—Nixon's government reorganization, for example—is
                              a kind of pseudo-decentralization for the benefit of the centralizers.]]></page><page Index="351"><![CDATA[Nevertheless, with all these cavils, there is no possibility of restoring
                              sense, order, and management "efficiency" to many governments
                              without a substantial devolution of central power. We need to divide
                              the decision load and shift a significant part of it downward.

                              This is not because romantic anarchists want us to restore "village
                              democracy" or because angry affluent taxpayers want to cut back on
                              welfare services to the poor. The reason is that any political structure—
                              even with banks of IBM 370 computers—can handle only so much
                              information and no more, can produce only a certain quantity and
                              quality of decisions, and that the decisional implosion has now pushed
                              governments beyond this breakpoint.

                              Moreover, the institutions of government must correlate with the
                              structure of the economy, the information system, and other features of
                              the civilization. Today, little noticed by conventional economists, we
                              are witnessing a fundamental decentralization of production and
                              economic activity. Indeed, it may well be that the basic unit is no longer
                              the national economy.

                              What we are seeing, as I have already stressed, is the emergence of
                              very large, more and more cohesive regional sub-economies within
                              each national economy. These sub-economies are increasingly
                              different from one another, with sharply divergent problems. One may
                              be suffering from un-employment, another from labor shortages.
                              Wallonia in Belgium protests the shift of industry to Flanders; the
                              Rocky Mountain states refuse to become "energy colonies" of the West
                              Coast.

                              Uniform economic policies stamped out in Washington, Paris, or Bonn
                              have radically different impacts on these sub-economies. The same
                              national economic policy that aids one region or industry increasingly
                              damages others. For this rea-son, a great deal of economic policy
                              making must be dena-tionalized and decentralized.

                              decentralization (witness a recent meeting of 280 of General Motors'
                              top executives who spent two days talking about how to break up
                              bureaucratic patterns and move more decisions out from the center),
                              but also an actual geographical decentralization as well. Business
                              Week reports a "geographical tilt of the U.S. economy, as more
                              companies build plants and move offices to less readily accessible
                              parts of the country."

                              All this reflects, in part, a gigantic shift of information flows in society.
                              We are, as noted earlier, undergoing a fundamental decentralization of
                              communications, as the power of the central networks wanes. We are
                              seeing a stunning proliferation of cable, cassette, computers, and
                              private electronic mail systems, all pushing in the same decentralist
                              direction.]]></page><page Index="352"><![CDATA[It is not possible for a society to decentralize economic activity,
                              communications, and many other crucial processes without also,
                              sooner or later, being compelled to decentralize government decision-
                              making as well.

                              All this demands more than cosmetic changes in existing political
                              institutions. It implies massive battles over control of budgets, taxes,
                              land, energy, and other resources. Decision division will not come
                              easily—but it is absolutely unavoidable in country after overcentralized
                              country.

                              So far we have looked at decision division as a way to break the
                              bottleneck, to unfreeze the political system so it can function again. But
                              there is far more here than greets the eye. For application of this
                              principle does more than reduce the decision load of national
                              governments. In a fundamental way, it changes the very structure of
                              elites, bringing them into conformity with the needs of the emerging
                              civilization.

                              THE EXPANDING ELITES

                              The concept of "decision load" is crucial to any understanding of
                              democracy. All societies require a certain quantity and quality of
                              political decisions in order to function. Indeed, each society has its own
                              unique decision structure The more numerous, varied, frequent, and
                              complex the decisions required to run it, the heavier its political
                              "decision load." And the way this load is shared fundamentally
                              influences the level of democracy in society.

                              In preindustrial societies, where the division of labor was rudimentary
                              and change was slow, the number of political oj administrative
                              decisions actually required to keep things run-

                              TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY DEMOCRACY

                              435

                              ning was minimal. The decision load was small. A tiny, semi-educated,
                              unspecialized ruling elite could more or less run things without help
                              from below, carrying the entire decision load by itself.

                              What we now call democracy burst forth only when the decision load
                              suddenly swelled beyond the capacity of the old elite to handle it. The
                              arrival of the Second Wave, bringing expanded trade, a greater
                              division of labor, and a leap to a whole new level of complexity in
                              society, caused the same kind of decision implosion in its time that the
                              Third Wave is causing today.

                              As a result, the decisional capabilities of the old ruling groups were
                              overwhelmed, and new elites and sub-elites had to be recruited to
                              cope with the decision load. Revolutionary new political institutions had
                              to be designed for that purpose.

                              As industrial society developed, becoming ever more complex, its
                              integrating elites, the "technicians of power," were in their turn
                              continually compelled to recruit new blood to help them carry the]]></page><page Index="353"><![CDATA[expanding decision load. It was this invisible but inexorable process
                              that drew the middle class more and more into the political arena. It
                              was this expanded need for decision-making that led to an ever-wider
                              franchise and created more niches to be filled from below.

                              Many of the bitterest political battles in Second Wave countries—the
                              struggle of American Blacks for integration, of British trade unionists for
                              equal educational opportunity, of women for their political rights, the
                              hidden class warfare in Poland or the Soviet Union—concerned the
                              distribution of these new slots in the elite structures.

                              At any given time, however, there was a definite limit to how many
                              additional people could be absorbed into the governing elites. And this
                              limit was essentially fixed by the size of the decision load.

                              Despite the Second Wave society's meritocratic pretensions, therefore,
                              whole subpopulations were screened out on racist, sexist, and similar
                              grounds. Periodically, whenever the society jumped to a new level of
                              complexity and the decision load swelled, the excluded groups,
                              sensing the new opportunities, would intensify their demand for equal
                              rights, the elites would open the doors a bit wider, and the society
                              would experience what seemed like a wave of further democratization.

                              If this picture is even roughly correct, it tells us that the extent of
                              democracy depends less on culture, less on Marxist class, less on
                              battlefield courage, less on rhetoric, less on po-

                              litical will, than on the decision load of any society. A heavy load will
                              ultimately have to be shared through wider democratic participation. So
                              long as the decision load of the social system expands, therefore,
                              democracy becomes not a matter of choice but of evolutionary
                              necessity. The system cannot run without it.

                              What all this further suggests is that we may well be on the edge of
                              another great democratic leap forward. For the very implosion of
                              decision-making now overwhelming our presidents, prime ministers,
                              and governments unlocks—for the first time since the industrial
                              revolution—exciting prospects for a radical expansion of political
                              participation.

                              THE COMING SUPER-STRUGGLE

                              The need for new political institutions exactly parallels our need for
                              new family, educational, and corporate institutions as well. It is deeply
                              wired into our search for a new energy base, new technologies, and
                              new industries. It reflects the upheaval in communications and the
                              need to restructure relationships with the non-industrial world. It is, in
                              short, the political reflection of accelerating changes in all these
                              different spheres.

                              Without seeing these connections, it is impossible to make sense of
                              the headlines around us. For today the single most important political]]></page><page Index="354"><![CDATA[conflict is no longer between rich and poor, between top-dog and

                              ideologies will not vanish. They may even—as suggested earlier—
                              grow more violent, especially if we undergo large-scale economic
                              turbulence. But all these conflicts will be absorbed into, and play
                              themselves out within, the super-struggle as it rages through every
                              human activity from art and sex to business and balloting.

                              This is why we find two political wars raging around us simultaneously.
                              At one level, we see a politics-as-usual clash of Second Wave groups

                              Wave groups cooperate to oppose the new political forces of the Third
                              Wave.

                              This analysis explains why our existing political parties, as obsolete in
                              structure as in ideology, seem so much like blurry mirror images of one
                              another. Democrats and Republicans, as well as Tories and
                              Labourites, Christian Democrats and Gaullists, Liberals and Socialists,
                              Communists and Conservatives, are all—despite their differences—
                              parties of the Second Wave. All of them, while jockeying for power
                              within it, are basically committed to preserving the dying industrial
                              order.

                              Put differently, the most important political development of our time is
                              the emergence in our midst of two basic camps, one committed to
                              Second Wave civilization, the other to Third. One is tenaciously
                              dedicated to preserving the core institutions of industrial mass
                              society—the nuclear family, the mass education system, the giant
                              corporation, the mass trade union, the centralized nation-state, and the
                              politics of pseu-dorepresentative government. The other recognizes
                              that today's most urgent problems, from energy, war, and poverty to
                              ecological degradation and the breakdown of familial relationships, can
                              no longer be solved within the framework of an industrial civilization.

                              The lines between these two camps are not yet sharply drawn. As
                              individuals, most of us are divided, with a foot in each. Issues still
                              appear murky and unconnected to one another. In addition, each camp
                              is composed of many groups pursuing their own narrowly perceived
                              self-interest, without any overarching vision. Nor does either side have
                              a monopoly on moral virtue. There are decent people ranged on both
                              sides. Nevertheless, the differences between these two subsurface
                              political formations are enormous.

                              The defenders of the Second Wave typically fight against minority
                              power; they scoff at direct democracy as "populism"; they resist
                              decentralization, regionalism, and diversity; they oppose efforts to de-
                              massify the schools; they fight to preserve a backward energy system;]]></page><page Index="355"><![CDATA[they deify the nuclear family, pooh-pooh ecological concerns, preach
                              traditional industrial-era nationalism, and oppose the move toward a
                              fairer world economic order.

                              By contrast, the forces of the Third Wave favor a democracy of shared
                              minority power; they are prepared to experiment with more direct
                              democracy; they favor both transnationalism and a fundamental
                              devolution of power. They call for a crack-up of the giant
                              bureaucracies. They de-

                              mand a renewable and less centralized energy system. They want to
                              legitimate options to the nuclear family. They fight for less
                              standardization, more individualization in the schools. They place a
                              high priority on environmental problems. They recognize the necessity
                              to restructure the world economy on a more balanced and just basis.

                              Above all, while the Second Wave defenders play the conventional
                              political game, Third Wave people are suspicious qf all political
                              candidates and parties (even new ones), and sense that decisions
                              crucial to our survival cannot be made within the present political
                              framework.

                              The Second Wave camp still includes a majority of the nominal power-
                              holders in our society—politicians, businessmen, union leaders,
                              educators, the heads of the mass media—although many of them are
                              deeply troubled by the inadequacies of the Second Wave world view.
                              Numerically, the Second Wave camp undoubtedly still claims the
                              unthinking support of most ordinary citizens as well, despite fast-
                              spreading pessimism and disillusionment in their ranks.

                              The advocates of the Third Wave are more difficult to characterize.
                              Some head up major corporations while others are zealous
                              anticorporate consumerists. Some are worried environmentalists;
                              others are more concerned with the issues oi sexual roles, family life,
                              or personal growth. Some focus almost exclusively on the
                              development of alternative energy-forms; others are mainly excited by
                              the democratic promis of the communications revolution.

                              Some are drawn from the Second Wave "right," others from the
                              Second Wave "left"—free marketeers and libertarKf ans, neo-
                              socialists, feminists, and civil rights activists, former flower children and
                              the straightest of straight-arrows. Some' are long-time activists in the
                              peace movement; others have never marched or demonstrated for
                              anything in their lives. Some are devoutly religious, others diehard
                              atheists.

                              Scholars may debate at length over whether or not so seemingly
                              formless a group constitutes a "class," or whether, if so, it is the "new
                              class" of educated information-workers, tellectuals, and technicians.
                              Surely many of those in the Third Wave camp are college-educated,
                              middle-class people. Surely many are directly engaged in the

                              How does one characterize women struggling to break out of confining
                              roles in Second Wave society? How, moreover, does one describe the
                              fast-expanding millions in the self-help movement? And what about
                              many of the "psychologically oppressed"—the millions of victims of the
                              epidemic of loneliness, the broken families, the single parents, the
                              sexual minorities—who do not fit neatly into the notion of class? Such
                              groups come from virtually all the ranks and occupations of society, yet
                              are important sources of strength for the Third Wave movement.

                              Indeed even the term movement can be misleading—-partly because it
                              implies a higher level of shared consciousness than so far exists, partly
                              because Third Wave people properly mistrust all the mass movements
                              of the past.

                              Nevertheless, whether they comprise a class, a movement, or simply a
                              changing configuration of individuals and transient groups, all of them
                              share a radical disillusionment with the old institutions—a common
                              recognition that the old system is now broken beyond repair.

                              The super-struggle between these Second and Third Wave forces,
                              therefore, cuts like a jagged line across class and party, across age
                              and ethnic groups, sexual preferences and subcultures. It reorganizes
                              and religns our political life. And, instead of a harmonious, classless,
                              conflict-free, non-ideological future society, it points toward escalating
                              crises and deep social unrest in the near-term future. Pitched political
                              battles will be waged in many nations, not merely over who will benefit
                              from what is left of industrial society but over who participates in
                              shaping, and ultimately controlling, its successor.

                              This sharpening super-struggle will decisively influence the politics of
                              tomorrow and the very form of the new civilization. It is as a partisan in
                              this super-struggle, aware or unwitting, that each of us plays a role.
                              That role can be either destructive or creative.

                              of the political forms we still take for granted. Caught between two
                              civilizations, it was their destiny to create.

                              Today in every sphere of social life, in our families, our schools, our
                              businesses and churches, in our energy systems and communications,
                              we face the need to create new Thii Wave forms, and millions of
                              people in many countries are already beginning to do so. Nowhere,
                              however, is obsolescenc more advanced or more dangerous than in
                              our political life And in no field today do we find less imagination, less
                              expe ment, less willingness to contemplate fundamental change.

                              Even people who are daringly innovative in their own work—in their
                              law offices or laboratories, their kitchens, classrooms, or companies—
                              seem to freeze up at any sugge tion that our Constitution or political
                              structures are obsolet and in need of radical overhaul. So frightening is
                              the pi pect of deep political change, with its attendant risks, that status
                              quo, however surrealistic and oppressive, sudder seems like the best
                              of all possible worlds..

                              Conversely we have in every society a fringe of pseudorev- ;
                              olutionaries, steeped hi obsolete Second Wave assumptions, for whom
                              no proposed change is radical enough. Archaeo-Marxists, anarcho-
                              romantics, right-wing fanatics, armchs guerrillas, and honest-to-God
                              terrorists, dreaming of tot tarian technocracies or medieval Utopias.
                              Even as we spe into a new historical zone, they nurse dreams of
                              revolutic drawn from the yellowed pages of yesterday's political tracts.

                              Yet what lies ahead as the super-struggle intensifies is not replay of
                              any previous revolutionary drama—no centrally rected overthrow of the
                              ruling elites by some "vanguai party" with the masses in tow; no
                              spontaneous, supposedlj cathartic, mass uprising triggered by
                              terrorism. The creation of new political structures for a Third Wave
                              civilization will not come in a single climactic upheaval, but as a
                              consequence of a thousand innovations and collisions at many levels
                              in many places over a period of decades.

                              This does not rule out the possibility of violence along the way to
                              tomorrow. The transition from First Wave to Second, Wave civilization
                              was one long blood-drenched drama wars, revolts, famines, forced
                              migrations, coups d'etat, calamities. Today the stakes are much higher,

                              need for a broadened democracy, they in fact can join in the process of
                              creating a Third Wave civilization, just as the most intelligent First
                              Wave elites anticipated the coming of a technologically based
                              industrial society and joined in its creation.

                              Most of us know, or sense, how dangerous a world we live in. We
                              know that social instability and political uncertainties can unleash
                              savage energies. We know what war and economic cataclysm mean,
                              and we remember how often totalitarianism has sprung from noble
                              intentions and social breakdown. What most people seem to ignore,
                              however, are the positive differences between present and past.

                              Circumstances differ from country to country, but never in history have
                              there been so many reasonably educated people, collectively armed
                              with so incredible a range of knowledge. Never have so many enjoyed
                              so high a level of affluence, precarious perhaps, yet ample enough to
                              allow them time and energy for civic concern and action. Never have
                              so many been able to travel, to communicate, and to learn so much
                              from other cultures. Above all, never have so many had so much to
                              gain by guaranteeing that the necessary changes, though profound, be
                              made peacefully.

                              Elites, no matter how enlightened, cannot by themselves make a new
                              civilization. The energies of whole peoples will be required. But those
                              energies are available, waiting to be tapped. Indeed if we, particularly
                              in the high-technology countries, took as our explicit goal for the next
                              generation the creation of wholly new institutions and constitutions, we
                              could release something far more powerful even than energy: the
                              collective imagination.

                              The sooner we begin to design alternative political institutions based
                              on the three principles described above—minority power, semi-direct
                              democracy, and decision division—the better our chances for a
                              peaceful transition. It is the attempt to block such changes, not the
                              changes themselves, that raises the level of risk. It is the blind attempt
                              to defend obsolescence that creates the danger of bloodshed.

                              This means that to avoid violent upheaval we must begin

                              now to focus on the problem of structural political obsolescence around
                              the world. And we must take this issue not merely to the experts, the
                              constitutionalists, lawyers, and politicians, but to the public itself—to
                              civic organizations, trade unions, churches, to women's groups, to
                              ethnic and racial minorities, to scientists and housewives and
                              businessmen.

                              We must, as a first step, launch the widest public debate over the need
                              for a new political system attuned to the needs of a Third Wave
                              civilization. We need conferences, television programs, contests,
                              simulation exercises, mock constitutional conventions to generate the]]></page><page Index="359"><![CDATA[broadest array of imaginative proposals for political restructuring, to
                              unleash an outpouring of fresh ideas. We should be prepared to use
                              the most advanced tools available to us, from satellites and computers
                              to video-disc and interactive television.

                              No one knows in detail what the future holds or what will work best in a
                              Third Wave society. For this reason we should think not of a single
                              massive reorganization or of a single revolutionary, cataclysmic
                              change imposed from the top, but of thousands of conscious,
                              decentralized experiments that permit us to test new models of political
                              decision-making at local and regional levels in advance of their
                              application to the national and transnational levels.

                              But, at the same time, we must also begin to build a constituency for
                              similar experimentation-—and radical redesign— of institutions at the
                              national and transnational levels as well. Today's widespread
                              disillusionment, anger, and bitterness against the world's Second
                              Wave governments can either be whipped into fanatic frenzy by
                              demagogues calling for authoritarian leadership or it can be mobilized
                              for the process of democratic reconstruction.

                              By launching a vast process of social learning—an experiment in
                              anticipatory democracy in many nations at once—we can head off the
                              totalitarian thrust. We can prepare millions for the dislocations and
                              dangerous crises that lie before us. And we can place strategic
                              pressure on existing political systems to accelerate the necessary
                              changes.

                              Without this tremendous pressure from below, we should not expect
                              many of today's nominal leaders—presidents and politicians, senators
                              and central committee members—to challenge the very institutions
                              that, no matter how obsolete, give them prestige, money, and the
                              illusion, if not the reality, of power. Some unusual, far-seeing politicians
                              or officials will

                              lend their early support to the struggle for political transformation. But
                              most will move only when the demands from outside are irresistible or
                              when the crisis is already so advanced, and so close to violence, that
                              they see no alternative.

                              The responsibility for change, therefore, lies with us. We must begin
                              with ourselves, teaching ourselves not to close our minds prematurely
                              to the novel, the surprising, the seemingly radical. This means fighting
                              off the idea-assassins who rush forward to kill any new suggestion on
                              grounds of its imprac-ticality, while defending whatever now_ exists as
                              practical, no matter how absurd, oppressive, or unworkable it may be.
                              It means fighting for freedom of expression—the right of people to
                              voice their ideas, even if heretical.

                              Above all, it means starting this process of reconstruction now, before

                              Like the generation of the revolutionary dead, we have a destiny to

                              ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

                              In writing The Third Wave I have drawn on several streams of
                              information. The first and most conventional comes from the reading of
                              books, journals, newspapers, reports, documents, magazines, and
                              monographs from many countries. The second has its source in
                              interviews with change-makers around the world. I have visited them in
                              then* laboratories, executive suites, schoolrooms, and studios, and
                              they have been generous with then* time and ideas. They range from
                              family experts and physicists to Cabinet members and prime ministers.

                              Finally, in traveling I have relied on what I trust is an alert eye and ear.
                              Often, firsthand experience or chance conversation sheds a revealing
                              light on abstraction. A taxi driver in a Latin American capital told me
                              more than all his government's cheery statistics: When I asked him
                              why his people were not doing something to protest a soaring inflation
                              rate, he simply imitated the stuttering of a machine gun.

                              It is clearly impossible for me to thank individually all those who have
                              been helpful. However, three friends, Donald F. Klein, Harold L.
                              Strudler, and Robert I. Weingarten, have taken the trouble to read the
                              entire manuscript and offer perceptive criticism and advice.

                              In addition, Lea Guyer Gordon and Eleanor Nadler Schwartz, who are
                              certainly among the best and and most professional editorial
                              researchers, fact-checked the completed manuscript to weed out
                              inaccuracies. Mrs. Schwartz stayed through the final, harried days to
                              give good-humored, be-yond-the-call-of-duty assistance during
                              preparation of the 444

                              Cenedella of William Morrow for her excellent round-the-clock
                              copyreading and correction. Finally, to Karen Tof-fler, who helped
                              format the conceptual entries in the index and committed them to the
                              computer/word processor during the long, late hours of the night.

                              Needless to say, I alone remain responsible for any errors that may
                              have crept into these pages, despite our best efforts to avoid them.

                              The produc-' tion enterprise is typically owned by the state rather than
                              by private investors, and it is subject to direct political controls in the
                              framework of a planned economy. But, like the capitalist corporation,
                              its prime functions are to concentrate capital and organize mass
                              production. Moreover, like its capitalist counterparts, it shapes the lives
                              of its employees; it exerts informal but powerful political influence; it
                              creates a new managerial elite; it relies on bureaucratic administrative
                              methods; it rationalizes production. Its position in the social order

                              Smith attributed the startling increase hi productivity to the increased
                              dexterity developed by the worker who specialized, to the time saved
                              by not switching from task to task, and to the improvements that the
                              specialized worker could make in his or her tools. But Smith clearly
                              recognized what lay at the heart of things: the market. Without a
                              market to connect producer to consumer, who would need or want
                              48,000 pins a day? And, Smith continued, the bigger the marketplace
                              the more specialization could be expected.

                              Smith was right.

                              This paper includes a well-known quotation from the American socialist
                              Daniel De Leon who, at the close of the last century, argued that "the
                              ladder by which humanity has risen to civilization is the progression hi
                              the methods of production, the growing power of the productive
                              instruments. The trust occupies the very top of this ladder. The social
                              storm of our times rages precisely around the trust. The capitalist class
                              is trying to retain it for its own exclusive use. The middle class is trying
                              to break it up, thereby delaying the course of civilization. The
                              proletariat will set for itself the goal to preserve it, improve it, i and
                              make it accessible to everyone."

                              whether it, too, should make or buy. One side, loosely called the
                              radicals, favors self-sufficiency and internal development; the other
                              favors wide trade with the outside world. The notion of self-sufficiency
                              will attract greater attention among non-industrial nations as they
                              increasingly come to recognize the hidden costs of entering into an
                              integrated world economy constructed to serve the needs of the
                              Second Wave nations.

                              about 830,000,000 pieces of mail last year—is expected to continue

                              the family—war, for example, or technological change— is often
                              immediate, while the impact of the family on society may be long

                              stands a shadowy fourth segment—a "phantom economy" based on
                              payoffs, graft, and corruption, without which many of the operations in
                              the other three segments would grind to a halt.

                              Greatly dependent upon infusions of technology and capital from the
                              global economy (and susceptible to its illnesses), the socialist industrial
                              nations are also caught up in forces larger than they can control.

                              bankruptcy and pleads with its creditors to stretch out the terms of loan

                              daily life into thirty-seven different kinds of activity, from working and
                              watching television to eating, sleeping, or visiting friends.

                              Without pretending to be at all scientific about it, I loosely lumped these
                              thirty-seven activities into three categories: those that seemed to me
                              the most "market- : intense," those that are not, and those that lie
                              some-J where hi between.

                              For example, the time we spend working for pay,: shopping in a
                              department store, or commuting to our j jobs is clearly more "market-
                              intense" than the time i we spend watering geraniums in the window
                              box, playing fetch with the family dog, or chatting with the neighbors
                              over the back fence.

                              Similarly, some activities, while not done for market purposes, are
                              nevertheless so commercialized as to lie in between. (Packaged travel
                              tours, ski weekends, even some get-away-from-it-all camping, involve j

                              so much purchased paraphernalia, so many paid-for services, and so
                              many economic transactions as to represent a modified form of
                              shopping.)

                              Using these crude categories I reviewed the time-budget studies. I
                              promptly discovered that some lifestyles—and some societies—are
                              more "market-intense** than others.

                              For instance, Americans in forty-four cities spent, on average, only 36
                              percent of their waking hours in market-connected activity. The
                              remaining 64 percent of their waking hours were spent cooking,
                              laundering, gardening, eating, brushing their teeth, studying, praying,
                              reading, volunteering in community organizations, watching TV,
                              chatting, or simply resting.

                              A similar pattern turned up in Western Europe: the average Frenchman
                              spent an equivalent amount of waking hours in market-connected
                              activity. For the Belgian it was a little more—38 percent For the West
                              German a little less—34 percent.

                              Ironically, as soon as we move eastward geographically and "leftward"
                              politically, numbers begin to climb. In East Germany, the most
                              technologically advanced of the Communist countries, the average
                              person spent 39 percent of his or her day in market-connected activity.
                              In Czechoslovakia the figure rose to 42 percent. In Hungary 44 percent
                              And in the Soviet Union it hit 47 percent.

                              It turns out, therefore, that mainly because of longer working hours but
                              for other reasons as well, the life-style of the ordinary citizen was more]]></page><page Index="392"><![CDATA[market-intensive in Pskov than in its American counterpart Despite

                              472 THE THIRD WAVE

                              is becoming big business these days. It is not limited to small
                              transactions between individuals, swapping a used sofa, let's say, for
                              some auto repair services, or exchanging legal services for dental
                              care. (Large numbers of people are discovering that barter can help
                              them avoid taxes.) Barter is becoming more important in the world
                              economy, too, as countries and corporations—uncertain about the fast-
                              changing relationships between hard and soft currencies—swap oil for
                              jet fighters, coal for electricity, Brazilian iron ore for Chinese oil. Such
                              barter is a form of exchange and therefore fits within Sector B.

                              But much of what self-help groups do can be characterized as a form
                              of psychic barter—the swapping of life experiences and advice. And
                              the housewife's traditional role can be interpreted as the barter of her
                              services for goods earned by a working husband. Are her services part
                              of Sector A or Sector B? Third Wave economists will begin to sort out
                              such questions—for until they do it will become increasingly impossible
                              to understand the real economy in which we live, as distinct from the
                              Second Wave economy now fading into history.

                              Similarly, we need to ask about the future of money. Money supplanted
                              barter in the past partly because it was so difficult to keep track of
                              complex swaps involving many different units of measurement Money
                              radically simplified record keeping. The growing availability of
                              computers, however, makes it easier to record extremely complex
                              trades and therefore makes money, as such, less essential. Again, we
                              have scarcely begun to think about such things. The rise of the
                              prosumer, its relationship to barter, and the new technology will
                              combine to make us think about old issues in new ways.

                              sector." An intense debate has arisen over this informal economy
                              which springs up within many of the world's poor countries. In it,
                              desperate millions attempt to eke out a living by doing odd jobs,
                              peddling, street hustling, making furniture, driving, shining shoes, doing
                              small-scale construction and other tasks. Some economists believe the
                              existence of this sector is positive, since it opens a channel through
                              which people make the transition into the formal economy. Other
                              economists insist the informal economy merely locks people into
                              permanent misery.

                              Whichever view proves correct, this informal sector is properly
                              characterized as "petty commodity produc-

                              tion" in the sense that it is part of the market economy. For this reason,
                              it differs fundamentally from what I have called the "prosumer sector,"
                              which is based on production for use instead. The informal sector fits
                              into what, in my terminology, is Sector B—production for exchange—
                              not Sector A—production for use, which I call prosumption.

                              346 Some World Bank projects do emphasize self-help or

                              sweat-equity approaches. See, for example, "The Bank and Urban
                              Poverty" by Edward Jaycox, in Finance & Development, September
                              1978. Director of the Bank's Urban Projects Department, Jaycox points
                              out another implication of the sweat-equity approach: "Because the
                              beneficiaries are expected to pay the costs [in the form of their labor], it
                              often becomes not only desirable but essential that they participate in
                              the decisions in planning and implementing the project." Presuming,
                              indeed, implies a higher degree of self-determination than production.
